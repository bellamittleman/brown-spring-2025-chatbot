One of the earliest systems was the Control of Electromagnetic Radiation (CONELRAD), established in 1951 during the Cold War to handle emergencies related to radio attacks. Subsequently, the Emergency Broadcasting System (EBS) was set up in 1963 to enhance emergency communications capabilities.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC), in collaboration with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the National Weather Service (NWS), oversees the Emergency Alert System (EAS) at the federal level. The roles and responsibilities of these agencies are outlined in a Memorandum of Understanding from 1981, an Executive Order from 1984, a Presidential Statement on EAS Requirements from 1995, and a 2006 Executive Order on Public Alert and Warning System.\n\nFCC regulations mandate that EAS Participants, including radio and television broadcasters and cable providers, must be able to receive and transmit National Emergency Messages (EANs). These participants also voluntarily broadcast alerts for local emergencies such as severe weather and child abductions. Alerts not categorized as National Emergency Messages are typically not delivered through a live audio feed but can be transmitted at the discretion of the EAS Participant. This approach, however, is not suited for comprehensive nationwide alert testing."}]}

The purpose of CONELRAD was to shut down most broadcasting stations to prevent incoming missiles from using broadcast signals for targeting. Certain designated radio stations, known as CONELRAD stations, would remain operational to disseminate emergency information to the public. This system was crucial for maintaining communication with the general public while mitigating risks of missile targeting."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain how the National Emergency Message alert system works?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! The National Emergency Message alert system is operated by FEMA, which initiates a nationwide alert using specific encoding equipment to send an EAN code to Primary Entry Point (PEP) stations. These are commercial and non-commercial radio stations that participate with FEMA to disseminate emergency information. When a PEP station receives the code, it opens a live audio channel to FEMA and broadcasts the emergency message throughout its area. Local Primary (LP) stations, which monitor PEP stations, receive and broadcast the message in their areas as well. This process involves various broadcasters and cable facilities to ensure the alert reaches as many people as possible."}]}

I would like to rework with you on the definition of \"auto dialer\", update it so that we can go after more of these bad actors.\n\nWe also in the last year and a half issued $650 million of fines.

Thank you."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ms. Rosenworcel: Yeah, we have heard from lots and lots of consumers. We have seen a 40 percent increase in the number of complaints about billing and charges related to ACP. These are people who are angry, upset, and bewildered by the fact this program has come to an end. They are from rural America, urban America, and everything in between. A disproportionate number of them are elderly, single parents, and retired military. And we have got heartbreaking emails that come to my inbox every day.\n\nAnd I know that Commissioner Starks and Commissioner Gomez spoke eloquently about this in their statements, so I would love it if they would continue the discussion. Mr. Starks: Yes, thank you. Agree with all that. You know, the numbers simply show that one in six households in America are enrolled. That is a big number. That is impacting a lot of folks."}]}

One of the initiatives that I had was Your Home, Your Internet, making sure that those that were in Federal housing assistance, HUD housing, Section 8 housing, that they knew about the program, they automatically were qualified. When I started that initiative, about 500,000 eligible households were enrolled. After the momentum that the FCC gained on it, nearly 2 million at the time of the freeze were enrolled. So it is a real number of folks that started to know about the program, see what it could benefit for them for telehealth, telemedicine, for young learners. And so I wanted to highlight that in the work that we have done coordinating with HUD, which is extraordinarily important."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thank you, Congressman. And by the way, thank you for the call as well. I enjoyed speaking with you very much. I absolutely agree with everything that the chairwoman and Commissioner Starks have said. We are hearing from consumers, heartbreaking emails that we get from them just about every day. In addition, when we go visit localities, we hear from parents who are extremely worried about how they are going to afford connectivity for their children. We hear from seniors who are relying on the ACP in order to maintain connections. And we hear from the veterans. This is both urban and rural areas nationwide, so it is a significant problem. As I mentioned earlier, I have lived with not having the resources to pay my bills and having to make the difficult decision between paying for food or paying for a phone bill. And this was before connectivity became so crucial to our daily lives. So this is a significant issue, and thank you for your leadership."}]}

Particularly given that $42 billion has been allocated but progress seems stagnant."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thank you for the question. I will start with your point about ACP and spending. The FCC conducted its own survey and found that out of this $17 billion, only 15 percent of respondents said they would lose internet service if the program expired. I believe as Congress looks into ACP, the focus should be on the 15 percent, or whatever number truly requires it, instead of pouring more money into the existing setup. \n\nAs for the BEAD initiative, despite the $42 billion promise to connect millions of Americans, 967 days have passed without any tangible progress, such as construction projects commencing. This delay is attributed to the additional red tape which has stalled progress rather than facilitating swift action to connect the nation."}]}

We can still do it. Let's stop trying to pursue DEI and just bridge the digital divide. Let's stop pushing these climate change agendas and just connect communities.

About one-third of our land nationwide is federally owned, and these areas are the least built out in terms of communications infrastructure. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act required the GSA to create a standard form, Form 299, for federal agencies when approached for construction projects. However, responses can take up to 270 days, whereas state and local deadlines are 90 to 150 days.

So those are huge challenges. And I know that in response to Beryl, the FCC announced the activation of the Disaster Information Reporting System and for the first time this mandatory initiative. So, Chairwoman Rosenworcel, with the time that we have, can you just talk a little bit about why it was important for the FCC to move this from a voluntary program to a mandatory program? And maybe just explain a little bit about what that will mean for my constituents, what some of the actions are that are required, and how in moments like this where we are really in crisis how your agency is working to help make sure that we have the resources and information that we need to stay in communication."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. Thank you.\nEveryone needs communication, and especially in crisis. And, unfortunately, the Texas Gulf Coast has had more than its fair share of weather events, and as a result, we started the disaster system that takes in data about when services are down. We also sent individuals down to the Houston area to work with FEMA on this. We have a lot of people who do that work, they do it quietly. They are real heroes.

And I have a little bit more time, so I also want to ask, one of the challenges we are seeing is, of course, keeping track of outages of all kinds, including the power outages. But also, I know that the agency recently issued an order classifying broadband as Title II service that will give the FCC insight into network outages, and that will ultimately, I think, benefit people in my district and across the country. Can you just talk a little bit more about what that will mean?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ms. Rosenworcel. Yeah. When broadband goes out, a community goes down. When it goes out in my house, you know, my children are ready for revolution. It is one of those circumstances that affects everything in modern life.

When I got to the agency and I took over, one of the first things I did was say, okay, we are going to do better maps. And then I studied it and I instantly understood why nobody had done it before. We had to build a data set of tax records, property records, satellite images that indicated where every single household is in the United States. And then we had to build a system that was capable of taking in data from all of our carriers, and then feedback and crowdsourced information from local, State, Tribal, and consumers all telling us what is going on. The system right now is terrific. We have got 115 million households that we indicate where broadband is. We know that in 6 million of them it is not present. But it can always be improved.

I think everyone is disturbed by the thought that a campaign could run an ad with their opponent saying or doing something that they didn\u2019t actually do with the use of AI to make that happen. But we want to make sure that we get this done in the appropriate way.

That's why it's crucial to handle this properly. The AI Task Force has examined this issue, emphasizing that it's more complex than just mandating a disclosure.

Certain uses, like editing a candidate's audio for clarity, could be harmless, while others are questionable and may demand disclosure or prohibition."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Indeed, I believe transparency is beneficial and necessary.

Firstly, there was a multi-phased agency move that required us to maintain duplicate operations for a significant period. This logistical complexity especially strained our information technology resources.\n\nAdditionally, ensuring Year-2000 compliance for all our mission-critical automated processing systems was a monumental task. This involved extensive system reviews and testing to make sure everything was compliant by the end of 1999. To safeguard against potential issues, we also created a comprehensive Business Continuity and Contingency Plan for each system.\n\nMoreover, budget constraints in Fiscal Year 1999 meant we couldn't complete certain critical network upgrades and performance goals.

The agency met all Congressionally-mandated auction schedules even though there were no such mandates in 1999, conducting six auctions and awarding about 1,700 licenses totaling $640 million. Another objective was to boost competition in telecommunications by efficiently licensing competitive services. The goal of meeting 90% of customer Speed of Disposal targets was mostly met despite some services falling short due to the development of new electronic filing systems, Y2K compliance efforts, and reducing a backlog of applications.
