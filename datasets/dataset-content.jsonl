Comment on whether eliminating certain logging requirements or replacing the '60 day' rule with a prompt repair rule would ease the burden on participants. We invite comments on the costs associated with EAS readiness improvements and request specific cost estimates. Consider whether estimating 2,000 annual notifications of equipment defects, as observed in the 2021 Nationwide EAS Test, is reasonable, and if this would entail an overall cost of $164,000 based on labor costs. We are open to detailed alternative suggestions for improving EAS readiness."}
{"content": "We propose revising the rule to mandate that an EAS Participant reports any unauthorized access to its EAS equipment to the Commission via NORS within 72 hours of awareness, irrespective of whether it led to a false alert transmission. This aims to mitigate cyberattack risks not only on EAS equipment but also on participants’ communication systems."}
{"content": "For this reason, we also propose to require that an EAS Participant report any incident of unauthorized access to any aspects of an EAS Participant’s communications systems and services that potentially could affect their provision of EAS. This would include infrastructure that serves to prevent unauthorized access to EAS equipment, including firewalls and Virtual Private Networks."}
{"content": "We believe the proposed rule is justified in light of the instances of false EAS alerts in recent years, caused by compromised EAS equipment being used to transmit a false message. As recounted above, we are aware of several situations in the past decade in which bad actors were either capable of obtaining, or actually obtained unauthorized access to EAS equipment."}
{"content": "Does unauthorized access to EAS equipment provide bad actors with the ability to disrupt EAS Participants’ regularly scheduled programming, which has the potential to inflict financial harm in relation to their advertisers and reputational harm with their audiences? Are there any other kinds of harms resulting from unauthorized access to EAS equipment that the Commission should consider?"}
{"content": "We believe significant public safety benefits would accrue if EAS Participants were required to provide the Commission with notification that their EAS equipment, communications systems, or services have been accessed without authorization, even in the absence of a subsequent transmission of a false alert."}
{"content": "It is a known tactic in cyber attacks for attackers to initially compromise a single device within a network and subsequently use it as a foothold to access and compromise additional devices before launching their main attack. By using proposed notifications, the Commission can collaborate with providers and government agencies to identify and mitigate a device compromise before it can be used to cause false Emergency Alert System (EAS) transmissions. Understanding the frequency and nature of such compromises can help the Commission assess the broader risks to EAS and strategize on measures to enhance its security."}

The plan submitted by Core Communications, Inc. includes refunding interstate access service charges assessed to interexchange carriers. This decision was made in accordance with FCC's rules and the directive from the Core Tariff Investigation Order, overseeing Core's compliance with tariff revisions and potential refunds."}
{"content": "On April 22, 2021, Core filed Transmittal No. 17, revising provisions of its interstate access services Tariff F.C.C. No. 3, addressing billing disputes, late-payment fees, and toll free (8YY) database query charges. Significant changes included increasing the monthly late-payment fee to the lesser of 3.0% or the highest legally permissible rate, unless part of a good faith dispute."}
{"content": "Federal Communications Commission initiated an investigation into the lawfulness of Core’s Revised Tariff, which was briefly suspended to allow it to take effect without being deemed lawful. This was followed by a Designation Order for Core to justify its late-payment fee provision as just and reasonable. AT&T and Verizon opposed Core's justifications, arguing against the fairness of the fee."} 

{"content": "The Commission's investigation concluded that Core's late-payment fee provision was not justified as reasonable, finding the 3% fee unreasonable and the language ambiguous. This provision contradicted the Commission’s rules and the Communications Act of 1934. The Commission ordered Core to remove the revisions made under Transmittal No. 17."}
{"content": "The Commission has mandated Core to remove the alterations introduced in Transmittal No. 17 and further instructed the Bureau to ensure the changes align with the Commission's conclusions. Additionally, the Bureau must calculate any customer refunds owed by Core, demonstrating an ongoing regulatory oversight to protect consumer interests."}

{"content": "The FCC has approved Core Communications' Refund Plan, which addresses overcharges due to an unlawfully high 3% monthly late-payment fee. Core will refund the difference to customers, as supported by their detailed spreadsheet calculations. Objections by Verizon were rejected due to inconsistency with legal provisions, while concerns from AT&T about the plan's impact on disputes were considered."}
{'content': 'asks the Commission to reject the Refund Plan, direct Core to submit a new plan, and bar Core from assessing any late-payment fees during the Refund Period. Verizon argues that Core’s Revised Tariff “imposed substantial costs on other carriers and on the Commission,” and that Core “should face consequences that deter the filing of such unlawful tariffs in the first place.”'}
{"content": "Verizon essentially is asking the Commission to award damages similar to punitive damages by requiring Core to forgo the 1.5% monthly late-payment fee that its tariff would otherwise allow during the Refund Period. Verizon does not contend that the 1.5% late-payment fee is unlawful, only that it and other customers should be granted other relief to dissuade Core from future unlawful tariff filings. But section 204 of the Act grants the Commission the authority to order refunds, not punitive damages. Verizon makes no argument that Core’s Refund Plan would not adequately compensate carriers for excessive charges they incurred as a result of Transmittal No. 17. We therefore deny Verizon’s request to direct Core to submit a revised refund plan that imposes no late-payment fees during the Refund Period."}

{"content": "In its comment, AT&T raises concerns about the potential impact of this Order on prior Commission decisions concerning Core’s tariffs, and pending litigation between Core and AT&T. We affirm that this Order neither modifies the Commission’s previous findings in this or any other related proceedings nor addresses pending litigation."}

{"content": "We find that the refunds proposed by Core are sufficient to implement the Commission’s decision in the Core Tariff Investigation Order. Core explains that it 'made no other changes to its Refund Plan at 2.' This implies that the refund plan, which proposes a downward adjustment rather than a direct refund, is adequate according to the investigation's findings."}
{"content": "Verizon has reversed its previous request for a lower rate, now proposing a 0% interest rate without providing an explanation beyond seeking punitive damages. The opposition argues that refund processes under Section 204 differ from individual damage claims under Section 208. Verizon expresses concerns that competitive local exchange carriers could exploit the 15-day review process for tariffs, potentially having rates deemed lawful with no immediate consequences. This stance is challenged as rates can still be assessed for future impact under sections 205 and 208. Meanwhile, Core's proposal to reduce the monthly late-payment fee from 3% to 1.5% for the Refund Period has been approved following the conclusion that other refunds were unnecessary."}
{"content": "The Federal Communications Commission has approved Core Communications, Inc.'s Refund Plan, which requires the company to issue refunds to customers affected by a revised late-payment fee. The plan eliminates the impact of the Revised Tariff on Core's customers, restoring the previous conditions.

Despite this, the company's daily operations remain under U.S. citizen control, as it continues to manage 236 radio stations through its subsidiaries. Emerging from bankruptcy in July 2021, New Alpha complied with regulatory conditions by filing a declaratory petition, addressing foreign ownership regulations."}

Additionally, New Alpha expects that holders of more than 91% of its Warrants will exercise them following the approval of the Petition. New Alpha states one group of Warrant holders, which has no intention to exercise their Warrants, will not require specific approval even on a fully diluted basis. Two additional Warrant holders, commonly controlled by a Cayman Islands limited partnership, might exceed 5% if fully exercised, but plan to transfer enough Warrants to keep the interest below 5%, thus avoiding the need for approval.

{"content": "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) stipulates that the count of locations for broadband support must exclude sites deemed ineligible due to factors such as being uninhabitable or requiring excessive infrastructure upgrades. If, by year eight, a location is determined as ineligible, it is deducted from the location count. Furthermore, if a carrier's location count falls below 65% of the initially specified CAM count, their financial support will be proportionally reduced. This adjustment ensures resources are allocated where they are most needed while maintaining fiscal responsibility."} 

{"content": "Carriers must adjust their location counts and corresponding support if newly identified locations are significantly fewer than originally estimated by the Cost and Model (CAM). This adjustment is based on a multiple of the initial authorized support and the ratio of actual to CAM locations.

{"content": "Applicants were reminded that one of the Commission’s core Universal Service Fund policy objectives is to avoid funding deployment in areas that already receive voice and broadband service from an unsubsidized provider. The Rural Digital Opportunity Fund was intended to focus on areas “wholly unserved by 25/3 Mbps” broadband service. Applicants were advised to assess whether existing service in the identified areas could affect their ability to meet program requirements and deployment milestones. They were informed that if they no longer wished to pursue support for a winning bid, they should identify those census block groups and provide a brief explanation of their decision to default on their bid(s). In response, some applicants chose to default on certain census blocks while retaining support for others within the same bid, leading to authorization for support only in areas where program requirements would be met."}

The latest report, focusing on ownership interests by gender, race, and ethnicity, captures data as of October 1, 2021. This report is part of an ongoing effort to provide periodic updates on commercial and noncommercial broadcast ownership. Initial electronic analyses were shared in 2012, documenting data from earlier reporting cycles. Subsequent reports have continued to offer insights into broadcasters' ownership structures, essential for informing the public, Congress, and policymakers. The current report examines five broadcast services: full power TV, Class A TV, low power TV, AM radio, and FM radio, as part of the seventh data collection with Form 323 and the third with Form 323-E."}
{"content": "In recent years, the FCC has consistently updated its reports on broadcast station ownership to ensure more accurate and reliable data collection. These revisions include significant changes made in 2009 to the ownership reporting form for commercial stations, aimed at enhancing the ability to search, aggregate, and cross-reference ownership data electronically."}
{"content": "In recent regulatory updates, noncommercial broadcasting stations have been aligned more closely with commercial stations regarding ownership reporting requirements. Per the 2016 323 and 323-E Order, noncommercial stations must now file biennial ownership reports on the same schedule as commercial counterparts, with a set 'as of' date of October 1. These changes were first implemented in the 2017 filing cycle, requiring noncommercial licensees to meet the December 1, 2017, deadline for submissions. This alignment in filing requirements aims to enhance transparency and accountability in the broadcasting sector."}
{"content":"The report examines broadcast ownership through gender, race, and ethnicity lenses, focusing on attributable interest holders as defined by FCC rules. It highlights majority ownership interests as critical due to their potential influence on operations."}
{"content": "The determination of majority ownership interest in broadcast stations is based on gender, race, or ethnicity, with a majority interest signifying that more than 50% of voting interests are held by individuals of the same demographic group. When this threshold is met by women, for example, the station is said to have a female majority ownership interest. Similarly, majority interests can be determined for racial and ethnic classifications. However, some stations do not have any discernable majority interest based on these demographic factors, leading them to be classified as having 'No Majority Interest.' The report follows government standards for classification, including two genders, six racial categories, and two ethnic distinctions, as outlined by the Office of Management and Budget. Further elaboration on ownership classification and reasons for the absence of discernable majority interest is provided in subsequent sections of the report."}
{'content': "The Federal Communications Commission released an overview of 2021 broadcast station ownership data, highlighting the breakdown of ownership across gender, race, and ethnicity. Among commercial broadcast stations, women owned 9%, men owned 61%, and white people owned 73%. Racial minority groups held a 4% ownership share, and Hispanic/Latino individuals owned 6%. In noncommercial sectors, women held a majority in 15% of stations, white individuals in 93%, and racial minorities in 3%."}
{"content": "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) report highlights the diversity in ownership of noncommercial broadcast stations. Notably, only 3% of these stations are owned by Hispanic/Latino individuals, while 94% are owned by non-Hispanic/Latino individuals. The report also provides demographic data for the U.S. population in 2021, which was fairly evenly split by gender and predominantly identified as non-Hispanic/Latino. When broken down by race, 61% identified as White, 12% as Black or African American, and 6% as Asian, among other groups. The report aims to offer insights into station ownership demographics and how they compare to the broader U.S. population."}

Thus, the categorization reflects the diversity and distribution of control within the licensee's ownership structure."}
{"content": "Having 'No Majority Interest' in a broadcast station indicates that it cannot be determined if any gender, race, or ethnic group holds a majority ownership stake. This is often due to certain ownership stakes not being reported, particularly when less than 5% of voting stock is held by an individual, as these do not need to be disclosed according to FCC rules."}
{"content": "Caveats and Clarifications: This report provides detailed information by gender, race, and ethnicity about the ownership of television and radio stations, relying on filers' data for accuracy. Control refers to actual control of the licensee, but reported interests focus on shared traits rather than de jure or de facto control. Therefore, a majority interest reported may not indicate actual control. Further analysis may be required to determine de facto control."}

However, both Form 323 for commercial and Form 323-E for noncommercial stations rely on the attribution standards set in Section 73.3555 of the Commission's rules."}

This change allows for a broader inclusion of attributable interest holders, although it acknowledges that the reported set may be incomplete for those stations.

The AEPMS, which monitors 375 sites in the U.S., claims to provide continuous oversight akin to ongoing inspections, ensuring all control devices and alarm systems are functioning properly."}
{"content": "AEP argues that its continuous monitoring and alert systems are equivalent to the requirements for frequent physical inspections of control devices on towers, similar to previously approved waivers for Eagle and Hark Systems. The company highlights its alarm notification, 24-hour polling, and staffing procedures as reasons for a waiver from section 17.47(b)."}
{"content": "Rcd 9743 (2007) (ATC and Global Tower Waiver Order) waived section 17.47(b) requirements for users of the Eagle and Hark Systems, focusing on alarm notification and monitoring protocols. At each AEPMS monitored tower, a network of alarms from the light controller contacts the AEP Network Operations Center (NOC) for various alarm conditions, classified as critical or minor. Critical conditions include beacon/strobe/flashing sidelight failure, beacon/strobe communication failure, photo cell failure, site communication failure, power failure, GPS Sync failure, filter failure, low flash energy, and consecutive missed flashes, while side and single marker failure are considered minor."} 

{"content": "The AEPMS database automatically escalates when alarms are detected, issuing a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) if the problem is not solved within 30 minutes. A NOTAM-worthy event prompts the creation of a field service ticket for inspection, to be completed within 7 days. Personnel can log into the system for diagnostics and attempt remote problem solving."} 

{"content": "The AEP System employs 24-hour polling, initiating connection from each monitored site at least once every hour. Lost communications generate an alarm prompting a NOC Technician to manually contact the site. If unsuccessful, a NOTAM is issued and responsible site contacts are alerted. Automatic alarm clearance updates are recorded in the system database."}

Communications to the AEP Network Operations Center are highly reliable, with digital cellular and internal networks designed to offer 99.5% and 99.999% availability, respectively. The AEP System includes redundant ring architecture systems to ensure connectivity even after failures. This redundancy allows immediate alarm notifications. The AEPMS has self-diagnostic features that negate the need for quarterly inspections, similar to systems previously evaluated and granted waivers by the Commission."}
{"content":"decisions, we conclude that AEP's implementation of the AEPMS is adequately robust to grant the requested exemption from the quarterly inspection requirements. This determination aligns with prior rulings where similar systems with constant monitoring and reliable backup procedures were deemed sufficient for exemption. Such systems include continuous monitoring, immediate reporting mechanisms, and 24/7 operational response centers, ensuring effective oversight and rapid response to tower issues."}

{"content": "The FCC handles complaints regarding unauthorized changes in telecommunications service providers, also known as 'slamming.' In a recent order, the FCC's Consumer Policy Division addressed a complaint about Lingo Telecom, LLC. The complaint alleged that Lingo changed the complainant’s service provider without proper authorization and verification, which is a violation of FCC rules. As a result, the FCC concluded that Lingo violated the slamming rules and granted the complainant's request for relief."}
{"content": "Section 258 of the Communications Act of 1934 prohibits 'slamming,' which is the unauthorized change in a subscriber’s telephone service provider. The FCC's rules require carriers to obtain subscriber consent before changing carriers, either through written authorization, a toll-free confirmation number, or verification by an independent third party. Rules also limit subscriber liability when unauthorized changes occur and require compensation from carriers involved in slamming."}
{"content": "The Federal Communications Commission's rules stipulate that if a carrier changes a subscriber’s telecommunications service provider without authorization, the original provider should be compensated for any charges incurred during the first 30 days of the unauthorized service. Charges for services post the 30-day period should be paid by the subscriber to the original carrier at previous rates. Furthermore, if the subscriber has paid the unauthorized carrier, that carrier must pay 150% of the collected charges to the authorized carrier, who in turn must refund 50% to the subscriber. Consumer complaints about unauthorized provider changes shift the burden of proof to the carrier to negate claims of misrepresentation. An accurate recording of sales calls may serve as effective evidence to counter these allegations."}
{"content": "The Commission investigated a complaint against Lingo alleging a misrepresentation during a sales call. Lingo submitted a 'Quality Control Call' recording and a signed contract but failed to provide the sales call recording or address the specific allegations. The Commission found the misrepresentation claim credible and ruled that the authorization to change carriers was invalid according to their guidelines. Consequently, Lingo’s change of the Complainant’s telecommunications service was unauthorized, as per Commission rules."}
{"content": "Lingo must remove all charges incurred for services provided to the complainant during the first thirty days following an alleged unauthorized change."}

The appeals in question were due to procedural errors by the participants, rather than non-compliance with core program requirements or fund misuse. The issues were related to processing deadlines, not program rules. Although deadlines are essential for the E-Rate program's administration, strict adherence in these instances did not serve the public interest or the purposes of section 254(h) of the Act. While the decisions pertained to the FCC Form 471 context, similar issues are noted with E-Rate reimbursement forms, such as FCC Forms 472 and 474, where timely-filed forms were denied for missed response deadlines."}

The common issue among the petitioners is clerical or procedural errors, affecting their funding requests or extensions for telecommunications services."}
{"content": "The FCC has determined that requests for E-Rate program funding should be reconsidered in cases of ministerial and clerical errors, similar to previous decisions on forms 470, 471, and 486. Many petitioners had their reimbursement forms denied due to these types of errors, leading to undue hardship. The Commission emphasizes that rigid adherence to deadlines does not align with section 254(h) goals nor serve the public interest, especially when there is no evidence of misuse or program violations."}

The FCC considers these appeals based on unique circumstances and procedural adherence."}

Specifically, the rules waived are section 54.719(b) and section 54.720, which pertain to the appeals process for reimbursement forms and extension requests errors. This decision is aimed at easing the process for petitioners listed in an appendix, allowing appeals to be treated as timely despite previous late filings."}

This process is especially significant during the comparative review of Noncommercial Educational (NCE) FM applications. The FCC first conducts a threshold analysis to determine fair distribution when applicants are mutually exclusive and propose services to different communities. An important aspect of this evaluation is identifying whether any applicant is a federally recognized Native American Tribe or Alaska Native Village, as they might have a priority under the Tribal Priority policy. If no Tribal Applicant is identified, the process moves to subsequent analysis steps."}
{"content": "In cases where no tribal applicant is present in an MX group, the Bureau undertakes the Section 307(b) analysis to ascertain if any applicant can provide a first or second reserved band channel NCE aural service to a significant population. This step involves evaluating whether an NCE FM applicant can serve at least 10% of the population within the service area, with a minimum of 2,000 people benefitting. The intention is to give a fair distribution preference to applicants meeting these criteria."}
{"content": "An NCE FM applicant can receive a fair distribution preference and secure a construction permit by identifying as a Tribal Applicant, proposing Tribal Coverage, and being the first to provide a reserved channel NCE service on Tribal Lands, as per the Tribal Priority guidelines set by the FCC."}

Initially, Big Bend was the tentative selectee but was later disqualified upon amending its application to reflect ineligibility for a fair distribution preference. Subsequently, Elijah provided a combined first and second Noncommercial Educational (NCE) service reaching 12,723 people, surpassing GPTC's service population of 6,971 by a significant margin, leading to GPTC's elimination. This analysis highlights the importance of accurate population data and certification in determining eligibility for NCE service preference."}

The discrepancy in the contact information and the lack of concrete evidence for site assurance undermines this assumption."}

{"content": "Americans are at risk of losing their health care coverage as changes to Medicaid's eligibility requirements come into effect. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is working to ensure individuals maintain their enrollment by permitting federal and state agencies, along with their partners, to make automated calls and send text messages. This communication is aimed at informing people about how to maintain their healthcare benefits without violating the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA). The changes initiated due to the COVID-19 pandemic have greatly increased Medicaid participation, and as the continuous enrollment mandate ends, millions will need to renew their eligibility amid staffing shortages in state agencies. HHS and its partners have been given room to navigate the TCPA to continue supporting consumers."}
{"content": "Millions of Americans are at risk of losing their Medicaid coverage once the public health emergency ends, which has prompted the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to reach out to the FCC for guidance. This situation has raised concerns about ensuring continued access to vital health services for low-income individuals."}

{"content": "The FCC is considering a request to allow certain robocalls and text messages to inform Medicaid enrollees about actions necessary to retain their coverage. The necessity for these communications arises as the public health emergency, which expanded Medicaid eligibility, comes to an end."}

{"content": "Under the TCPA, calls using prerecorded messages or automatic dialing systems require the recipient’s consent unless they are for emergency purposes. The FCC's decision will address if reminders about Medicaid renewals fall under the emergency category, allowing them to bypass usual consent requirements."}
{"content": "The Commission has stated that simply providing a telephone number can be considered \"prior express consent\" for communication related to the purpose for which the number was provided unless instructed otherwise."}
{"content": "Federal and state governments conducting official business are not considered a \"person\" under section 227(b)(1) of the TCPA, as clarified by the Commission."}
{"content": "Under the TCPA, an \"automatic telephone dialing system\" requires the capacity to store or produce numbers using a random or sequential number generator, as determined in the Facebook, Inc. v. Duguid case."}
{"content": "The Commission has exempted certain artificial and prerecorded voice calls from TCPA regulations if they are not for commercial purposes or do not contain unsolicited advertisements, focusing on protecting consumer interests."}
{"content": "The Federal Communications Commission's 2003 TCPA Order identifies text messaging as a form of communication consistent with making a \"call.\" Similarly, federal regulations define \"prior express written consent\" requirements, clarifying circumstances where individuals provide such consent. For instance, the provision of a cell phone number by a consumer to a creditor can indicate consent to be contacted regarding debt. Similarly, students or parents giving phone numbers to educational institutions implies consent to receive relevant communications."}
{"content": "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) determined that calls made by federal and state governments are not subject to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) prohibitions on using automated equipment without prior consent from the called party. However, contractors working for these governments, as well as local governmental entities and their contractors, are considered \"persons\" under the TCPA unless the federal or state government is directly involved in making the call."}

{"content": "On April 28, 2022, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) requested clarification from the FCC regarding the legality of automated calls and texts under the TCPA. These communications aim to encourage individuals to renew enrollment in programs like Medicaid, CHIP, BHP, or the Health Insurance Marketplace, especially important as the COVID-19 public health emergency winds down and continuous enrollment requirements may end."}

{"content": "HHS expressed concerns about millions of vulnerable Americans potentially losing Medicaid coverage once the public health emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic concludes. They assert that these coverage losses can be mitigated if state agencies and affiliates are allowed to use automated calls, text messages, and prerecorded voice messages to guide individuals on the necessary steps to maintain their health program enrollments."}

```
{"content": "The responsibility to determine whether a governmental entity or its contractor is the 'maker' of a call is a nuanced, fact-intensive task that must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis."}

{"content": "The Families First Coronavirus Response Act allowed for increased federal matching funds for Medicaid programs, conditional on maintaining enrollment until the public health emergency concludes. Changes enacted in December 2022 allow states to restart Medicaid disenrollments starting April 1, 2023."}

{"content": "A Public Notice was issued seeking commentary on HHS’s requested clarification regarding autodialed calls and texts for health program communication."}  
{"content": "Supporters of HHS's request highlight the risk of vulnerable populations losing health benefits and view automated messages as effective aids in communication."}
{"content": "Commenters emphasize the effectiveness of autodialed calls and text messages in reaching vulnerable groups such as low-income, elderly, and non-English speaking individuals for health care benefit information. There is a consensus on the beneficial impact of these methods for communication."} 

{"content": "These autodialed communications are instrumental for government programs like Medicaid, reaching groups that might otherwise be difficult to contact. Various agencies and organizations have expressed support for the continued use of these methods to ensure vital information dissemination."} 

{"content": "Despite the agreement on the benefits of autodialed communications, there is a discussion on the need for a free-to-end-user exemption to address issues when telephone numbers are reassigned, rather than attributing the calls to the government."} 

{"content": "Two commenters have raised concerns that permitting HHS' request could lead to an increase in unwanted communications, highlighting the need to balance effective outreach with consumer privacy."}
{"content": "Commenters express concerns that granting HHS’ request may lead to increased unwanted robocalls without limitations to prevent abuse."}
{"content": "Effective communication by government agencies is essential in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuring health care program coverage."}
{"content": "Providing a phone number on Medicaid applications is considered consent for contact regarding enrollment eligibility and related matters."}
{"content": "Government agencies can use autodialers to reach enrollees even without prior express consent in certain cases."}
{"content": "Callers have alternative methods to contact enrollees without violating the TCPA."}
{"content": "The clarification helps ensure vulnerable Americans receive critical information about their health care benefits."}
{"content": "The ruling does not signal a reduction in efforts to combat illegal calls and texts, including those exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic."}
{"content": "Phone scammers have exploited the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic to target individuals in the United States, prompting organizations like the National Consumer Law Center (NCLC) to propose measures to protect consumers. These suggestions include ensuring no charges to recipients for calls and texts, checking the Reassigned Numbers Database, limiting calls to one per day and seven in fourteen days, and restricting calling hours. Additionally, they recommend using voice and text providers that offer Caller ID and STIR/SHAKEN attestations, and safeguarding against insurance scam calls mistaken for legitimate government communications. Authorities are urged to use enforcement powers to combat these scams effectively."}
{"content": "eligibility for and ongoing enrollment in government health care programs. This interpretation aligns with Commission precedent and recognizes the necessity of ensuring consumers are informed about their benefits. Given the potential for scam and hoax communications, the FCC emphasizes the importance of vigilance and compliance with regulations to protect consumers from unwanted calls and texts."}
{"content": "Consumers who apply for benefits in government healthcare programs often expect and welcome calls and texts regarding their coverage. These communications may inform them of important requirements or potential loss of coverage. As they have provided their phone numbers for such purposes, calls or texts aiming to prevent benefit termination are viewed as directly related to their initial reason for sharing contact details. It is important, however, that entities making such calls do so under the guidance and authorization of a governmental agency to ensure compliance with the TCPA."}

{"content": "In the ACA Declaratory Ruling, the FCC clarified that providing a wireless number on a credit application implies consent to be contacted regarding the debt. This consent extends to third-party debt collectors."}
{"content": "The Blackboard Declaratory Ruling confirms that when a parent or student gives a phone number to a school, it implies consent to receive messages related to the school’s educational mission, unless specified otherwise."}
{"content": "Consumers have not consented to advertising or telemarketing calls or texts, which require written consent after disclosures. Provision of a phone number is not sufficient for these types of communications."}
{"content": "Revocation of prior express consent can be done using any reasonable method, both orally or in writing. Callers must honor revocation requests for autodialed or prerecorded communications."}
```
{"content": "Telecommunications providers must respect revocation requests for calls and texts related to governmental health care programs, ensuring they only contact consenting individuals. The burden of proving consent lies with the caller, who must demonstrate that the called number was provided on a governmental health care application. Moreover, if a number has been reassigned, even with initial consent, TCPA liability may arise unless callers verify using the Reassigned Numbers Database. Federal and state governmental agencies are generally exempt from TCPA restrictions when making automated calls for specified purposes."}
{"content": "A consumer's written consent to receive telemarketing robocalls must be signed and show that they received clear disclosure of the consequences, specifically that they will receive prerecorded messages from a specified seller, and agree in writing to receive such calls. This is outlined in the FCC's 2015 TCPA Order and related regulations, which also mandate that messages must identify the sending agency and provide opt-out information."}
{"content": "Federal and state government callers do not require prior express consent for calls and texts made as part of official business, according to the FCC. The Commission has clarified that calls from such agencies regarding matters like health care program enrollment are not subject to TCPA restrictions, provided they are conducted in the course of official duties."}
{"content": "The document discusses the involvement of federal or state agencies in communication campaigns when third-party contractors are used. It highlights the complexity of determining when an agency is considered the maker of a call if they are not directly placing the call or sending the text. This determination involves assessing factors such as decision-making on call timing, recipients, and content. The record currently lacks specific facts to make a definitive ruling. The document notes that guidance may be provided in the future if specific cases with clear roles are presented. Discussion references previous FCC rulings and emphasizes that contractors are subject to the TCPA."}
{"content": "Entities covered under the TCPA must adhere to specific restrictions, as outlined in various FCC rulings and orders. The DISH Declaratory Ruling and 2015 TCPA Order provide a multi-factor analysis for determining third-party liability under the TCPA, which includes factors like enabling fraudulent spoofing. Federal and state contractors making calls on behalf of governmental bodies might qualify for derivative immunity, which is assessed on a case-by-case basis. Government contractors are advised to consult existing immunity law to determine their eligibility for such protections."}
{"content": "consent. It is important for callers to evaluate the content of their messages carefully to determine if they fall under telemarketing or advertising, which would necessitate prior express written consent from the recipients. On the other hand, purely informational calls related to Medicaid, CHIP, BHP, and Marketplace eligibility and enrollment processes do not require this consent, as they aim solely to inform enrollees about their benefits. This provides a pathway for local governments, governmental contractors, and managed care entities to communicate important informational updates without breaching TCPA regulations, provided they strictly adhere to the non-commercial nature of these calls."}
{"content": "Under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), entities that lack derivative immunity are required to obtain prior express written consent before making calls. Additionally, when using artificial or prerecorded voice messages, these calls must comply with the Commission's identification requirements."}
{'content': 'The FCC provides guidance on compliance with TCPA regulations, highlighting that artificial or prerecorded voice message calls must identify the caller at the start and provide a callback number during or after the message. Communication alternatives such as live calls and emails are suggested for HHS to avoid TCPA restrictions.'}

It's important to note that the Fabric is a geospatial dataset that includes geographic coordinates for broadband serviceable locations. Filers should ensure they do not submit challenges for locations already in the Fabric. Address data should not be used as the sole determinant for geographic locations since the Fabric is not an address database."} 

{"content": "When preparing a bulk Fabric challenge, entities should focus on the geospatial aspect. Address lists from other databases, like billing systems or E911, can initially guide challengers. However, challengers must align address data with Fabric's location IDs rather than simply uploading unmatched data. Just because an address is not in the Fabric does not mean the location is missing."}
{"content": "The FCC uses the Broadband Serviceable Location Fabric (BSLF) as a foundation for mapping broadband service availability. Version one of this Fabric is currently in use and has data from June 30, 2022. Individual challenges regarding location data can be submitted via the National Broadband Map (NBM) interface, and updates will be aligned with changes in version two of the Fabric."}
{"content": "The FCC encourages challengers to use geospatial analysis when reviewing address data against the Fabric data, ensuring only new or potentially unrecognized locations are put forward. This involves loading Fabric data into a geospatial tool and incorporating additional datasets like billing and E911 data, as well as imagery and road data, to refine the challenge list. By performing analysis, locations already designated as BSLs can be eliminated, focusing efforts on undisputed points. Key steps include disregarding points near existing BSLs and those located directly on roads without footprints. Thorough assessment of resultant points will determine if a formal challenge to the FCC is necessary."}

The actions were in violation of the Commission's slamming rules, which prohibit unauthorized service provider changes. Section 258 of the Communications Act mandates that carriers receive explicit subscriber approval before making changes. Clear Rate's non-compliance resulted in the complaint being upheld by the FCC."}
{"content": "To combat unauthorized carrier changes, known as 'slamming', the Commission mandates specific measures such as obtaining signed authorization, confirmation via a toll-free number, or verification by an independent third party. Subscribers have limited liability when unauthorized changes occur, and unauthorized carriers must compensate affected subscribers. The rules, detailed in 47 CFR §§ 64.1100 – 64.1190, also prohibit misrepresentations during sales calls to prevent slamming practices."}
{"content": "The Commission's rules state that if a consumer's telecommunications service provider is changed without their authorization, the unauthorized carrier must pay 150% of the charges to the authorized carrier. Additionally, the authorized carrier is required to refund or credit 50% of all charges paid by the consumer to the unauthorized carrier. If a sale was misrepresented during the call, any consumer’s complaint alleging unauthorized changes shifts the burden of proof to the carrier."} 

{"content": "Upon receiving a complaint that a consumer’s telecommunications service was switched without authorization, Clear Rate responded, claiming the consumer had agreed to the change. However, Clear Rate failed to provide a recording of the original sales call, instead offering third-party verification recordings and a quality assurance call."}
{"content": "Clear Rate did not provide a recording or any evidence related to the sales call, leading to a finding that the Complainant's allegation of sales call misrepresentation is credible. Clear Rate failed to rebut this claim, rendering Complainant's authorization to change carriers invalid. This decision aligns with the 2018 Slamming Order, which states that a consumer's authorization based on false sales call information is not binding. Consequently, Clear Rate's actions resulted in an unauthorized change in the Complainant's telecommunications service."}

{"content": "The FCC acknowledges that its current rule, which causes delays in informing customers of breaches, might not align with modern expectations for urgency in such matters. Prompt notification is crucial for mitigating personal information breaches, yet law enforcement might require delays to facilitate investigation. The Commission is considering proposals to amend these rules, seeking public feedback on the potential benefits and downsides of notifying consumers at a quicker pace, while respecting specific scenarios where law enforcement requests a delay."}
{"content": "The benefits of eliminating the seven business-day waiting period for customer notification after a data breach include quicker engagement of the affected customers in taking actionable steps to protect their information. This could potentially reduce the risk of misuse of their information. On the other hand, drawbacks might involve insufficient time for carriers to thoroughly assess the breach's scope, which could hinder identifying the sources and minimizing further data loss. A \"without unreasonable delay\" standard might provide carriers with the necessary flexibility to report breaches in a timely manner without being constrained to a fixed period, potentially balancing law enforcement needs with customer protection imperatives. Additionally, aligning with existing data breach notification laws at state and federal levels could ensure consistency and leverage established practices for effective breach management."}
{"content": "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is considering the implications of federal and state laws on the notification timelines for data breaches. Specifically, they question whether the standard of notifying customers \"without unreasonable delay\" provides adequate clarity or if a fixed notification period would be more effective. Notable examples include HIPAA, which mandates notification no later than 60 days after discovery of a breach, and various state codes requiring expedient notification without unreasonable delay. Public comments are sought on whether a standardized timeframe should be implemented to guide organizations on breach notification processes effectively."}
{"content": "Setting a definite time limit for breach notification ensures that affected individuals are informed promptly, allowing them to take necessary actions to protect their information. However, it could also pressure companies to act hastily, potentially leading to incomplete or inaccurate notifications."}

{"content": "The Hyundai HyTab 7WC1 and Amazon Fire 7 are two devices similar to the Scepter 8 in terms of technical specifications. With the Hyundai priced between $50 to $60 and the Amazon Fire priced at $65 (or $50 with an ad-supported lock screen), they help establish a base market value for the Scepter 8 at $50."}
{"content": "Among 8-inch screen devices, the Hyundai HyTab 8WC1 is most similar to the Scepter 8. Priced at $70, it featured the same processor and RAM but offered double the ROM, marginally faster speed, and a better camera than the Scepter 8. Thus, the Scepter 8's market value is less than $70."}
{"content": "Considering devices with comparable specifications, the optimal market value for the Scepter 8 is estimated at $60. This mid-point price reflects various considerations, including its non-brand status (unlike the Amazon Fire), absence in retail settings, and negative consumer reviews. The PassMark benchmark ranks it 4,358th out of 4,400 devices, placing it in the bottom 2% for performance."}

We find that Q Link has apparently received an overpayment of at least {[ ]} per device for each of the {[ ]} connected devices for which it claimed reimbursement during the EBB Program."}

{"content": "Q Link knew or should have known the market value of its device was far less than it claimed when it sought reimbursement. The technical specifications of the Company’s device were substantially inferior to those that Q Link asserted were comparable."}

{"content": "Despite this, the Company falsely stated in its election notice that the market value of the device was {[ ]}. Q Link’s Chief Executive Officer certified with each monthly claim for reimbursement during the entire EBB Program that the amount Q Link claimed reflected the market value of the device."}

{"content": "In November 2021, Q Link claimed that its EBB connected device and the reimbursement rate were approved by USAC, contrary to the Commission's policy. The Commission had decided against pre-approving the retail values of connected devices for the EBB program, opting instead for a system of back-end audits to ensure honesty in reimbursement claims. Providers were required to certify under penalty of perjury that their claims reflected the market value of the devices and adhered to other specified conditions. Therefore, USAC did not give approval for Q Link’s reimbursement rate for EBB connected devices."}
{"content": "2022. This apparent overpayment constitutes a significant violation of the EBB Program rules and highlights the issues surrounding the certification and reimbursement processes. The discrepancies between the claimed market value and the actual market value of the Scepter 8 tablet reveal a need for more stringent oversight and accountability measures in the administration of the program."}
{"content": "Q Link received an overpayment of approximately $50 per device for numerous devices from May 12, 2021, to March 15, 2022, resulting in a total overpayment of $32,900,700 during the EBB Program."}
{"content": "Q Link claimed excessive reimbursements for connected devices between December 16, 2021, and March 15, 2022, resulting in an overcollection of at least $20,792,800 from the Fund."}

{"content": "In assessing forfeitures, considerations include the nature and gravity of the violation, previous offenses, the violator's ability to pay, and potential economic gains, with adjustments made for egregious, intentional, or harmful violations."}
{"content": "Q Link allegedly engaged in egregious violations by claiming excessive reimbursements from the EBB Program, exceeding the market value of connected devices between December 16, 2021, and March 15, 2022. This action potentially deprived eligible households of funds. The analysis of device specifications and retail prices indicated overcollection of approximately $20,792,800, impacting the allocation of resources meant for others."}
{"content": "Reimbursement for EBB connected devices resulted in an overcollection from the Fund amounting to approximately $20,792,800. Q Link's claims and certifications for reimbursement above market value were treated as separate violations, totaling numerous breaches of section 904(b)(5) of the Act and related sections. Given the novelty of EBB Program rules, the Commission's forfeiture guidelines and case law lack a base forfeiture for these specific rule violations. Considering the totality of circumstances and factors in section 503(b)(2)(E) of the Communications Act, a forfeiture amount based on treble the harm to the Fund is deemed appropriate. The Commission has previously suggested forfeitures partly based on three times the amount of improper reimbursements in other contexts. Any misallocated dollar from the EBB Program undermines its goal to make broadband affordable for low-income Americans. The proposed approach aims to penalize Q Link's violations and prevent similar future transgressions by other broadband providers. Further action will determine the final amount of Q Link’s overcollection, with indications that they claimed significantly more per device than entitled."}
{"content": "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has proposed a significant forfeiture penalty of $62,000,000 against Q Link for apparent violations related to overcharging for device support in the Emergency Broadband Benefit program. Q Link is accused of claiming more reimbursement than it was entitled to, undermining the program intended to aid households in need. The Commission emphasizes the importance of compliance with regulations and has ordered Q Link to justify its actions in writing within 30 days. This penalty reflects the seriousness of accurately requesting federal support to maintain the integrity of the reimbursement system."}

{"content": "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in its regulation under 47 CFR § 90.20 outlines the eligibility for licensing in the 4.9 GHz band. Eligible licensees include state and local government entities, along with certain nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that support critical safety communications. The 4.9 GHz band is notable for its shared access, meaning no single licensee has the exclusive right to use the band. Operations authorized in this band cover entire 50-megahertz channels, allowing for flexible use across geographic jurisdictions as specified by the licensee. Licensees are permitted to operate various types of stations, such as base stations and mobile units, within their jurisdiction. However, eligible entities can also perform fixed point-to-point and point-to-multipoint operations on designated channels, with broadband service delivery sites receiving primary status. The FCC rules permit licensees to function beyond their jurisdiction with requisite permissions, resulting in occasionally overlapping licenses among geographic locations using the same spectrum."}
```jsonl
{"content": "Licenses covering a given location can authorize operations on the same spectrum, allowing for multiple fixed-site licenses in the same area. This flexible structure was established by the Commission based on the unique history of coordination among public safety agencies in using shared frequencies. Historically, however, the 4.9 GHz rules have not specified a formal coordination requirement."}
```
```jsonl
{"content": "The rules under 47 CFR § 90.523 allow nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that provide services aimed at protecting the safety of life, health, or property to hold a license in the band. To be eligible, an NGO must secure and maintain support from a state or local governmental entity whose mission aligns with protecting life, health, or property and must provide written certification of such support in applications."}
```
```jsonl
{"content": "In the case of a nonprofit organization, a license is issued within the legal jurisdiction of the supporting state or local government entity. Some licenses are issued only for part of a licensee’s jurisdiction, defined by a point and a specified radius of operation. This ensures that operations are limited to a certain geographic scope."}
```
```jsonl
{"content": "An example of overlapping licenses could be a statewide license held by the state police, a county-wide license by the sheriff's department, and fixed-site licenses by various public safety entities operating in the same area. Licensees typically cooperate informally to avoid or resolve any operational interference, leveraging their history of inter-agency coordination in frequency usage."}
```
{'content': 'Licensees in the 4.9 GHz band cooperate to prevent and resolve interference through informal coordination, supported by existing protocols for frequency sharing among public safety agencies. As of now, there are 3,541 licenses in this band, including statewide, countywide, and other area or fixed site licenses. This wide coverage supports various operations like video streaming and data connections, and may expand to include robotics and IoT applications. The band, designated for public safety use in 2002, is reserved for entities involved in public safety operations.'}
{"content": "The 4.9 GHz band is designated for exclusive use by public safety entities, and its regulations have been adapted over time to accommodate new technologies and changing needs. It is utilized for various safety operations, with licenses held by different states and agencies for management and deployment. For instance, Southwestern New Hampshire District Fire Mutual Aid holds a license under the call sign WQNM520, covering multiple counties. Though a statewide license covers most U.S. states and territories, exceptions include regions like American Samoa and South Dakota. Maryland demonstrates comprehensive utilization of this spectrum with multiple licenses, such as those for its Department of Information Technology and State Highway Administration. Recent discussions and recommendations by bodies like the National Public Safety Telecommunications Council and International Association of Fire Chiefs emphasize the potential of the 4.9 GHz band in supporting innovations like unmanned aerial systems and the Internet of Things for enhanced public safety."}
{"content": "Robotics and the Public Safety Internet of Things (PS IoT) have been at the forefront of discussions regarding the efficient use of the 4.9 GHz band. The allocation of specific channels within this band for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), robotics, and IoT technologies is expected to enhance spectrum utilization. Despite existing regulations, some aeronautical mobile operations have been permitted via rule waivers, as seen in the case of the City of Long Beach, California."} 

{"content": "The FCC has been actively working to increase the use of the 4.9 GHz band to foster technological innovation and maximize its spectrum potential. The Sixth Further Notice, adopted on March 23, 2018, was a significant step in this direction, incorporating feedback and plans from organizations like NPSTC and APCO to explore ways to stimulate investment in the band."}

{"content": "In an effort to maintain stability while considering rule changes, the FCC implemented a freeze on new applications for licenses in the 4.9 GHz band on September 8, 2020. This freeze applies to both geographic area licenses and individual fixed-site licenses, as announced by the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau and the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau."}

{"content": "Background: The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is conducting a comparative consideration of 34 groups of mutually exclusive (MX) applications for new noncommercial educational (NCE) FM station construction permits. This process involves a threshold fair distribution of service analyses and the use of a point system to tentatively select an application for grant in each group. Interested parties must file any petitions to deny these applications within 30 days of the release of this Order."}

{"content": "Recently, the Commission issued a public notice identifying 231 groups of mutually exclusive NCE FM applications. The examination of the 34 groups in this Order is part of a larger effort to address applications filed during a specific filing window in November 2021 for new NCE FM stations. Applicants had the opportunity to resolve mutual exclusivity through settlement agreements, and now face a simplified comparative process as defined in Part 73, Subpart K, of FCC rules."}
{"content": "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) applies comparative procedures to grant construction permits for Non-Commercial Educational (NCE) FM stations due to the high demand for limited spectrum. These procedures involve three key steps: 1) a fair distribution analysis based on the Communications Act, 2) an NCE point system to resolve remaining application conflicts, and 3) a simplified paper hearing process if needed. The FCC’s approach aims to effectively distribute NCE services without an auction process, giving priority to the fair distribution of services to different communities."}
{"content": "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has applied comparative procedures to tentatively select 27 Noncommercial Educational (NCE) FM applications from the November 2021 window for grant. Six conflicting NCE applications, which cannot all be granted under the Commission's technical rules, are considered mutually exclusive. Mutual exclusivity in this context means that an application is deemed mutually exclusive if it conflicts with another application in the group."} 

{"content": "The FCC has previous frameworks governing Noncommercial Educational Applicants as articulated in reports such as the 2000 NCE Order, and subsequent reexaminations, ensuring the regulatory rules are clear for NCE applicants.

Historical orders like the NCE Omnibus Order, and the referenced 47 CFR sections, lay the groundwork for evaluating applications within mutually exclusive groups, expediting consideration by providing objective selection criteria."}
{"content": "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) uses a point system for selecting non-commercial educational (NCE) FM applications, as detailed in 47 CFR § 73.7003. If there is a tie, they use applicant-provided data and certifications to make a determination. Section 307(b) of the Communications Act requires the FCC to ensure fair and equitable broadcast service distribution across states and communities. This involves a threshold fair distribution analysis in the NCE FM comparative review process, giving priority to Native American Tribes or Alaska Native Villages serving Tribal Lands. If no Tribal Applicants exist, the FCC evaluates whether any applicant provides first or second reserved band channel NCE service to a substantial population, which can influence their preference."}
{"content": "The Commission has implemented new rules to expedite the initiation of services to the public while reducing unnecessary burdens on applicants. The Media Bureau has announced an effective date for these rules, emphasizing fair distribution across communities, especially for unserved or underserved populations.

If there's no clear winner in terms of first service, the Commission then analyzes the second service levels. This ensures that the applicant offering the most substantial increase in coverage to previously underserved populations receives the permit, aligning with the FCC's goal of promoting equitable access to broadcast services across diverse communities."}
{"content": "Applicants' first service levels are used to determine if a proposal is superior, warranting preference. If first service levels are equivalent or no clear preference exists, combined first and second NCE aural service totals are considered. Disfavored applicants regarding Section 307(b) eligibility are eliminated until a preference can be assigned, or all applicants serve the same community, leading to a point system analysis."}
{"content": "In cases involving mutually exclusive (MX) groups with a Tribal Applicant for Noncommercial Educational (NCE) FM stations, a Tribal Priority applicant will prevail over any MX applicant claiming the First or Second NCE Service Preference, as specified in 47 CFR § 73.7002(b). The Commission uses a point system for selecting among such applications, as outlined in 47 CFR § 73.7003. Applicants must provide fair distribution of service data using the 2010 Census, per the NCE Filing Procedures Public Notice. Any changes made to enhance an application's fair distribution position post-filing are not permissible, though engineering changes that diminish this position must be reflected in an amended application.

Tie-breakers are used if multiple applicants have the same score."}
{"content": "In the event MX applicants are tied with the highest number of points, the process to resolve this begins with tie-breaker criteria. First, the number of radio station authorizations attributable to each applicant is considered, with the applicant having the fewest authorizations prevailing as the tentative selectee. If a tie persists, the number of pending radio station applications is evaluated, and the applicant with the fewest pending applications in the same service becomes the tentative selectee. In cases where a tie still exists, a final tie-breaker looks at prior NCE applications. The selectee will be the applicant demonstrating previous application experiences, continuity as a legal entity, and no current NCE permits or licenses. If this fails, time-sharing agreements become the last resort solution, with applicants submitted a voluntary agreement within 90 days."}

This standard includes both telecommunications and non-telecommunications services when identifying similar services for calculating urban and rural rates. USTelecom argued about the lack of notice and comment as per the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) regarding the inclusion of non-telecommunications services. However, the Commission clarified that notice was provided in the 2017 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, indicating potential changes in interpreting similar services."}

{"content": "Taking these arguments into account, we conclude that we should not deviate from the Commission’s prior conclusion in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order that the 30% range allows for rate predictability while accounting for the rising demand for faster connectivity. Having a standard for determining similar services based on a range is preferable to having speed tiers, which would need to be frequently refreshed so they would not become out of date, as was the case with the speed tiers that existed before the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order. Moreover, based on the record previously developed, a range of 30% provides a sufficiently large number of inputs for determining rates under Methods 1 and 2."}

Through our continued review of data currently collected on the FCC Form 466, we have identified five primary issues impacting the ability to calculate rates: (1) services reported by healthcare providers are not defined by a single factor such as technology or speed; (2) some reported rates are based on distance whereas others are not; (3) value-added services beyond data transmission are not reported; (4) bundled prices offered by service providers make “apples-to-apples” rate comparisons difficult; and (5) the form does not measure the impact of SLAs on the rates offered."}

We especially request recommendations for additional individual descriptors for the items listed below. The following items are being considered: Contract Type. In many instances, services reimbursed under the RHC Program are often part of a contract that bundles many services together. We propose adding a field that would indicate if the underlying contract includes a bundle and what services the bundle covers. Data collected would include the total number of endpoints serviced and an indicator of the 'contract type' to better support rate accuracy."}

Federal Communications Commission FCC 21-58 has established certain limitations on per-location and per-user support for eligible equipment and services. These restrictions are meant to optimize the use of limited funds. Eligible schools and libraries can receive support for only one fixed broadband Internet access connection per location and one connected device and Wi-Fi hotspot per student, school staff member, or library patron during the COVID-19 emergency."} 

{"content": "While Wi-Fi hotspots are movable, fixed broadband is tied to specific locations. Under section 7402(b) of the Act and section 254(h)(2)(A) of the Communications Act, support is limited to one fixed broadband connection per location, without similar limitations on Wi-Fi hotspots. The FCC acknowledges that many distributed Wi-Fi hotspots are insufficient for multiple users, suggesting that homes with multiple students, staff, or patrons could benefit from more hotspots. In multi-tenant environments such as apartment buildings, each unit is considered a separate location for broadband support purposes."}
{"content": "In a multi-tenant environment such as apartment buildings, there is a prohibition on providing more than one supported connection and one connected device per user, with an exception for fixed broadband connections, which have a one-per-location limit.

{'content': 'The debate around Wi-Fi hotspot limitations at locations showcases varied opinions: some urge no limits on hotspots at sites, while others find a single connection sufficient if additional equipment is allowed. A distinct view is that fixed broadband should be limited to one per household and mobile broadband to one per student. However, some argue against hotspot support for households with existing connections. The need for more than one connection per user lacks concrete examples, with the American Library Association’s scenario of parents requesting separate devices for themselves and their children being seen as consistent with the one-device rule. Thus, many remain unconvinced of the necessity for multiple connections or devices per user, with economic feasibility guiding reimbursement limits.'}
{"content": "The Commission has decided to impose a per-user limitation on reimbursements for connected devices and Wi-Fi hotspots in schools and libraries. This decision aims to equitably distribute limited funds and prevent unnecessary warehousing of equipment. Each person will be limited to one device and one Wi-Fi hotspot. This measure ensures that as many students, school staff, and library patrons as possible can access the needed technology and broadband services in the near term. Libraries seeking reimbursement for an excessive number of devices based on their size may be subject to further inquiries by USAC."}

Applicants can request a waiver if the cost exceeds $400 and the public interest justifies it. The waiver should demonstrate that the cost is necessary to meet the needs of those with disabilities beyond the $400 limit set by the Program."}

{"content": "For Wi-Fi hotspots, a $250 maximum cost is adopted based on advertised prices. Schools or libraries spending more can seek a waiver, similar to connected devices. This approach aims to ensure equitable access without exhausting the Emergency Connectivity Fund through excessive reimbursements."}
{"content": "Verizon and other stakeholders have suggested specific caps on the pricing of educational devices, recommending values like $500 and $300 to cover devices such as iPads and Chromebooks. Federal funds may supplement these caps if device costs exceed $400, ensuring that students with disabilities can access suitable technology. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has capped support at $250 for equipment, excluding service costs. More analysis is required for pricing on other eligible equipment such as modems and routers."}
{"content": "The Commission has directed USAC to scrutinize requests for funding of modems, routers, and combination devices to ensure they align with similar applications. This is due to the insufficient record to determine a standard maximum support amount, and we do not foresee significant demands on the Fund for these devices. Guidance will be provided by the Bureau to evaluate the reasonability of costs, taking supply chain issues and geographic variations into account. Applicants need to justify their expenses to qualify for full reimbursement. Additionally, USAC is directed to assess applications for advanced telecommunications services, identifying those with abnormal costs, and offering bulk purchase agreements for broadband services at typically $10 to $25 per month, although variations are expected based on the location and school or library's circumstances."}
{"content": "The cost of broadband services for schools and libraries can vary significantly depending on a number of factors. Rural areas, in particular, face unique challenges due to limited competition and geographic obstacles. To ensure fairness, USAC and the Bureau will utilize the reasonable comparability benchmarks established by the High Cost Universal Service Support Program, which includes specific considerations for Alaska. These benchmarks are updated annually by the Bureau and the Office of Economics and Analytics, helping to assess the reasonableness of broadband costs, especially in rural locations."}
{"content": "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued an order adopting a reimbursement level for broadband services on Tribal lands up to $75 per month, compared to $50 in other areas, under the Emergency Broadband Benefit Order. Additionally, entities receiving high-cost or Connect America Fund support are mandated to offer broadband services at prices that meet or fall below the reasonable comparability benchmark set by the FCC. Concerns were raised regarding the sufficiency of funding for the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program to meet the emergency needs of schools and libraries, prompting the FCC to streamline the application process for quicker fund access. Despite suggestions, the FCC decided against allocating funds based on student numbers or library size, opting instead for established E-Rate support models."}
{"content": "Libraries applying for E-Rate support for internal connections, known as category two services, must meet specific benchmarks to ensure reasonable broadband service comparability. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has set these guidelines and directed the Bureau to create an Alaska-specific benchmark. Carriers in the Alaska Plan must adhere to Alaska-specific standards, certifying compliance with these benchmarks, which vary based on service bandwidths and usage allowances. An example of related guidelines includes the results of the 2021 Urban Rate Survey for Fixed Voice and Broadband Services, which provides data and required usage allowances for Eligible Telecommunications Carriers."}

{"content": "The rollout of fifth-generation (5G) wireless telecommunications networks in the United States has raised concerns within the aviation industry. Passenger and cargo airlines, alongside other aviation operators, fear that specific mid-band or C-band 5G signals could interfere with aircraft radio altimeters. In response, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued alerts to aircraft operators in late 2021, warning about potential safety risks associated with flight operations. The FAA requested data from aircraft operators, encouraged pilot education regarding possible disruptions, and restricted certain flight procedures as a precaution."}
```
```jsonl
{"content": "In response to the concerns over 5G interference, telecommunications companies agreed to voluntarily postpone the deployment of 5G service near airports, originally set for early December 2021, now delayed until July 2022. This decision was influenced by the FAA, the Department of Transportation, the White House, and some Members of Congress seeking to prevent air travel disruptions. The postponement grants additional time for the FAA and avionics equipment manufacturers to assess if C-band 5G signals could interfere with flight operations, potentially necessitating equipment upgrades or other protective measures to ensure aircraft systems are shielded from 5G interference."}
```
```jsonl
{"content": "Globally, 5G networks are being installed utilizing various frequency bands assigned differently across countries. The primary concerns raised by the FAA and aviation stakeholders do not involve low-band (below 1 gigahertz) and high-band (above 24 gigahertz) 5G frequencies. Instead, the anxiety stems from the assignment of C-band frequencies, typically ranging from 3 to 5 gigahertz, due to potential interference with radio altimeters. For context, Europe has allocated the spectrum between 3.4 and 3.8 gigahertz for C-band 5G, while Japan uses frequencies ranging from 3.4 to 4.1 gigahertz."}
```
{"content": "In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the use of spectrum between 3.7 and 3.98 GHz for 5G in 2020 and auctioned licenses in this band to telecommunications providers for over $81 billion. These providers are keen to launch services to recoup these costs and leverage 5G technology, offering customers faster data speeds and greater reliability than 4G service."}
{"content": "Vertical guidance is crucial below 200 feet in low-visibility conditions when pilots can't see the runway clearly. This capability is vital for all-weather commercial flights, but radar altimeters are rare on small general aviation planes. In 2015, the FAA and global aviation regulators highlighted concerns about C-band wireless deployments. They warned that 5G signals on nearby frequencies might interfere with radio altimeters, especially near airports. Although most radio altimeters have filters to block such interference, it's unclear if they'll stop high-powered 5G signals effectively."}
{"content": "A study by the RTCA, a technical advisory group, found that 5G emissions in the 3.7-3.98 GHz range and stray emissions into the 4.2-4.4 GHz band could exceed safe interference levels. This applies to all types of aircraft with radio altimeters. The study concluded that stray 5G emissions could violate international radiofrequency protection criteria if they bled into the radio altimeter band. In response, the FCC claimed the RTCA assumed worst-case scenarios and argued that their own protections, such as signal strength limits and spectral separation, would mitigate interference risks."}
```jsonl
{"content": "FCC-mandated protections, including limits on the strength of 5G signals and 220 MHz of spectral separation between 5G signals and radio altimeters, are designed to mitigate potential interference issues. The FCC asserts that well-designed radio equipment should be resistant to harmful interference from 5G signals."}
{"content": "Telecommunications providers agreed to delay the rollout of 5G from early December 2021 to January 2022, giving the FAA additional time to address concerns about radio altimeter interference. Initially, the FAA restricted certain flight procedures at 88 airports due to potential risks from C-band 5G signals."}
{"content": "5G service providers voluntarily delayed activating transmitters near airports until July 5, 2022, establishing temporary buffer zones to reduce interference risks. If the FAA continues to have concerns, it may impose further flight restrictions, leading to costly diversions in low visibility conditions."}
{"content": "Despite the creation of temporary 5G buffer zones, some airlines canceled or altered flights in January 2022 due to persistent uncertainty around possible 5G interference with low-visibility operations, affecting both domestic and international carriers."}
```
{"content": "Countries around the world are addressing concerns over 5G interference with aviation systems differently. In Europe, where 5G frequencies are more separated from radio altimeter bands compared to the U.S., the rollout has been smoother. European nations, like France, enforce measures such as reducing tower power, placing antennas in buffer zones, and directing them downwards to mitigate interference. Japan also adopted restrictions, especially near airport approach paths, due to their closer frequency allocation. However, U.S. telecom providers show hesitance in implementing similar counteractive steps, fearing reduced service quality and competitive disadvantages."}
{"content": "As of late January 2022, the FAA has provisionally approved roughly 90% of the U.S. commercial airline fleet equipped with radio altimeters to conduct low-visibility landings at airports with nearby 5G towers. The FAA is collaborating with industry groups like RTCA and EUROCAE to develop new minimum operational performance standards for future radio altimeters that are immune to potentially harmful 5G interference. Once established, manufacturers can design and supply compliant units, though costly replacements may prompt airlines to seek federal relief."}
{"content": "Helicopters used in medical emergencies rely on radio altimeters for safe landings, particularly when picking up patients. Acknowledging their critical societal role, the FAA has granted temporary regulatory relief from radio altimeter requirements for medical helicopters conducting night vision goggle operations, allowing ground observers to guide pilots. This exemption expires in 2024, at which point upgraded radio altimeters may be required."}

```
```jsonl
{"content": "The complexity of defining a cyber crisis stems from differing thresholds that determine when a cybersecurity incident becomes a crisis. A cybersecurity incident involves compromising the availability, authenticity, integrity, or confidentiality of data or services within network and information systems. An incident is significant when it causes severe operational disruption, financial loss, or notable damage to other entities."}
```
{"content": "A cyber incident is considered large-scale when it exceeds the capacity of a Member State (MS) to respond or affects at least two MS significantly. If an MS cannot mitigate it alone, the incident reaches 'large-scale' status. This can escalate into a cyber crisis, a term defined by the severity of the incident and political decisions. At the EU level, a cyber crisis often refers to incidents that directly cause significant disruptions due to cybersecurity breaches, where handling requires a collective response."}
```jsonl
{"content": "The notion of cyber crisis is based on several EU cyber regulations and policies. NIS2 highlights that a large-scale cybersecurity incident may escalate into a crisis that disrupts the internal market or poses security risks.

```
{"content": "In the EU, the transition from a cyber incident to a large-scale incident or full-blown crisis is largely influenced by the individual member state's risk appetite. Declaring a cyber crisis at the MS level is a political decision tied to perceptions rather than just factual occurrences. According to the Report on Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Management (2014), the escalation to crisis status is subjective, shaped by political and organizational perceptions and constraints. What one states perceives as a crisis, another may see as routine, adding subjectivity to crisis escalation. Once a state's tolerance threshold is surpassed, an incident may no longer be managed with usual means, compelling a crisis declaration. At the EU level, consensus among all member states following standard operating procedures is required for such a declaration. A cyber crisis's severity is evaluated based on factors like causes, nature, and impact, guiding necessary crisis management responses. Causes for a cyber crisis range from physical to non-physical, including cyberattacks from malicious actors and human errors."}
```jsonl
{"content": "Physical causes of cyber crises include targeted actions by malicious actors, such as cyberattacks, which may escalate into larger crises. Human errors, malfunctions, and malicious actions can disrupt networks and information systems (IS), resulting in crises.

{"content": "Emergency communications are vital for first responders during both regular operations and large-scale emergencies. These systems facilitate communication between emergency personnel and the public. Key components include 911 systems for emergency calls, land mobile radio (LMR) systems for communication amongst emergency services, and the First Responder Network (FirstNet), a developing broadband network for nationwide voice and data communication. Alerting systems also play a role by warning the public of danger. However, different technologies often limit interoperability, like the inability of 911 systems to send text messages to field responders. Federal, state, and local agencies are investing in IP-based technologies to enhance this interoperability."}
{"content": "Federal, state, and local public safety agencies are investing in Internet Protocol (IP)-based technologies to improve communications, coordination, and response. The federal government has created an IP-based national alerting system that allows authorized agencies to send a single alert through multiple alerting systems. They have also invested in FirstNet, a nationwide seamless, IP-based, high-speed mobile communications network that enables public safety users to communicate via voice and data with other public safety agencies. Additionally, there is interest in upgrading 911 systems to next generation IP-based systems, facilitating data sharing and system interconnection."}
{"content": "As emergency communications systems converge toward a common IP-based platform, opportunities arise alongside challenges. Advancements in geo-location technologies can help locate 911 callers more effectively, but integrating these technologies into legacy 911 systems poses difficulties. Although officials can now send alerts to mobile phones, some people still rely on landline phones for communication. Interconnecting systems could improve information sharing but also raise concerns about the privacy and security of data flowing across multiple networks."}
{"content": "IP-based technologies enable the interconnection of emergency communications systems, creating the potential for nationwide systems. This emergence may necessitate new policies that integrate these technologies into response plans and protocols. It also calls for policies that support collaborative planning, training, and exercises across all government levels to enhance response capabilities. Funding the migration to new technologies presents a significant challenge, as not all jurisdictions may have the financial resources required for the advancement."}
{"content": "The 116th Congress might focus on evaluating the effectiveness of emergency communications during disasters and the roles of various governmental and private telecommunication entities. This includes oversight of federal support programs such as the National 9-1-1 Program, FirstNet, IPAWS, and efforts by the Emergency Communications Division in CISA, as well as federal grants that improve emergency communication systems."}
