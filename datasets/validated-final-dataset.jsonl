One of the earliest systems was the Control of Electromagnetic Radiation (CONELRAD), established in 1951 during the Cold War to handle emergencies related to radio attacks. Subsequently, the Emergency Broadcasting System (EBS) was set up in 1963 to enhance emergency communications capabilities.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC), in collaboration with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the National Weather Service (NWS), oversees the Emergency Alert System (EAS) at the federal level. The roles and responsibilities of these agencies are outlined in a Memorandum of Understanding from 1981, an Executive Order from 1984, a Presidential Statement on EAS Requirements from 1995, and a 2006 Executive Order on Public Alert and Warning System.\n\nFCC regulations mandate that EAS Participants, including radio and television broadcasters and cable providers, must be able to receive and transmit National Emergency Messages (EANs). These participants also voluntarily broadcast alerts for local emergencies such as severe weather and child abductions. Alerts not categorized as National Emergency Messages are typically not delivered through a live audio feed but can be transmitted at the discretion of the EAS Participant. This approach, however, is not suited for comprehensive nationwide alert testing."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert in historical emergency alert systems and regulations."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain what CONELRAD was and its purpose during the Cold War?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "CONELRAD, which stands for Control of Electromagnetic Radiation, was a Cold War emergency system implemented to manage radio and television transmissions during an enemy missile attack. The purpose of CONELRAD was to shut down most broadcasting stations to prevent incoming missiles from using broadcast signals for targeting. Certain designated radio stations, known as CONELRAD stations, would remain operational to disseminate emergency information to the public. This system was crucial for maintaining communication with the general public while mitigating risks of missile targeting."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain how the National Emergency Message alert system works?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! The National Emergency Message alert system is operated by FEMA, which initiates a nationwide alert using specific encoding equipment to send an EAN code to Primary Entry Point (PEP) stations. These are commercial and non-commercial radio stations that participate with FEMA to disseminate emergency information. When a PEP station receives the code, it opens a live audio channel to FEMA and broadcasts the emergency message throughout its area. Local Primary (LP) stations, which monitor PEP stations, receive and broadcast the message in their areas as well. This process involves various broadcasters and cable facilities to ensure the alert reaches as many people as possible."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you tell me about PEP stations and how they function during national alerts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "PEP stations, also known as Primary Entry Point stations, serve as the main source of initial broadcast for national alerts. They are equipped with backup communications equipment and power generators to ensure they can continue broadcasting information to the public during and after an event."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How do EAS Participants receive emergency alerts over the Internet?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "EAS Participants receive emergency alerts over the Internet through the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS). They are required to be able to receive alerts formatted in Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) from authorized emergency alert initiators via IPAWS. CAP-formatted alerts offer multiple media formats like audio, video, and data files and can provide more detailed information through links."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "How can I assist you today?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Could you explain what CAP is in the context of emergency alert systems?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! The Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) is an open, interoperable standard developed by the Organization for the Advancement of Structure Information Standards (OASIS). It uses an XML-based language that is common for web documents. CAP messages contain standardized fields that enhance interoperability between devices and are backwards-compatible with the Emergency Alert System (EAS) Protocol. This means they can facilitate communication across different platforms. However, any additional information in CAP messages, such as enhanced text or video files, cannot be converted into the EAS Protocol, limiting distribution through the traditional broadcast system."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a knowledgeable AI."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you tell me why CAP messages cannot be distributed via the broadcast-based distribution system?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "CAP messages cannot be distributed via the broadcast-based distribution system because the regulations outlined in 47 CFR \u00a7 11.51 specify the technical standards and requirements for the Emergency Alert System, which does not support CAP message broadcast through this method."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a knowledgeable AI."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How does the digital signature help in the protection of the CAP message?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The digital signature in a CAP message provides authentication to ensure that the message has not been altered from its original form and confirms the identity of the sender, thereby enhancing the message's security and integrity."}]}

I want to welcome you all to this session where we discuss the fiscal year 2025 budget for the Federal Communications Commission. This is a crucial meeting as we address the needs and allocations for a sector that continues to expand and evolve rapidly. We aim to ensure that the FCC has the appropriate resources to enhance communication infrastructure and technology."}]}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "Good morning and welcome to today's oversight hearing of the Federal Communications Commission. This is the third time we have had the FCC before us this Congress, and I am pleased that we are maintaining a cadence of consistent oversight hearings."}
{"role": "user", "content": "Thank you. Can you state if there are any condolences to offer?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "I want to start by once again offering our condolences to the chairwoman for the loss and passing of her father. We hope that memories of him have helped her cope during this very difficult time. Although we can disagree on policy, we can come together to share each other's grief. On behalf of the committee, we are very sorry for his passing."}
{"role": "user", "content": "What were the main topics addressed in the last FCC hearing?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "The last time the FCC was before us, we discussed its role in President Biden's broadband takeover and its overregulation of the communications industry. Unfortunately, the agency has continued down this path."}
{"role": "user", "content": "What actions has the FCC taken regarding broadband?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Earlier this year, the FCC voted to reclassify broadband as a common carrier under Title II of the Communications Act under the guise of net neutrality. This action expands the FCC's authority over broadband, allowing the agency to impose burdensome regulations that will make it harder for proprietors to deploy broadband."}
{"role": "user", "content": "Do you find these actions necessary?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "As I stated before, this action is absolutely unnecessary. In 2017, after the FCC reversed the Obama FCC's re-classification of broadband, the Democrats told the world that we would get the internet one word at a time and that the internet as we knew it would end. As we all know, none of these fears came true. In fact, the day after the order was rescinded, I asked my office to keep track of how many of my constituents experienced issues, and none were reported."}
{"role": "user", "content": "I have many concerns about the recent actions taken by the FCC regarding net neutrality. How do they affect internet providers and consumers?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "The recent actions by the FCC to reimpose certain regulations are seen by some as a hindrance to U.S. leadership in broadband technology. Providers argue that these actions make it more challenging and expensive to deploy broadband services, ultimately impacting consumers by potentially increasing costs and limiting access. They believe that a light-touch regulatory framework had previously encouraged investment and improved service by allowing companies more flexibility."}
{"role": "user", "content": "What's an example of how U.S. networks have succeeded compared to other regions?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. broadband networks were able to handle increased usage as many aspects of daily life moved online. In contrast, European regulators had to request that websites like YouTube and Netflix throttle their services to manage demand. This indicates that U.S. networks were more robust, which some attribute to fewer regulatory constraints that encouraged private investment and infrastructure development."}
{"role": "user", "content": "How are States involved in net neutrality, and what has been their impact?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "While some States have enacted their own net neutrality policies, this wasn't a significant factor in maintaining the stability of the internet post-repeal by the FCC. Very few States enacted regulations, and none came close to the comprehensive utility-style regulations that had been repealed. The general consensus, according to some stakeholders, is that the lack of heavy-handed regulation allowed for better network performance and continued investment in broadband technology."}

The FCC is committed to addressing these critical areas and we are working diligently to implement effective solutions."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I am especially excited about the FCC's recently announced cybersecurity pilot program for schools and libraries. Cyber attacks on our schools are only growing in frequency and sophistication. From 2016 to 2022 alone, our K-12 schools suffered over 1,600 cyber attacks. According to the GAO, every cyber attack at high school districts costs tens of thousands and even up to millions of dollars."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Indeed, cybersecurity is a top priority, and the pilot program is designed to enhance protections for our schools and libraries. We understand the critical need to safeguard educational institutions from cyber threats."}, {"role": "user", "content": "That is why I introduced the Enhancing K-12 Cybersecurity Act to improve school access to cybersecurity resources and nationwide tracking of K-12 cyber attacks. That is also why I have long urged the FCC to modernize cyber tools for schools by adopting a pilot program."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your efforts are commendable, and the FCC is aligned with your goals to enhance cybersecurity in education. We look forward to working together to achieve these objectives."}]}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "Earlier this month, the FCC reported that nearly 40 percent of Rip and Replace funding recipients said they can't finish replacement work without full funding for the program. These providers are at risk of shutting down their networks or withdrawing from the Rip and Replace Program. This is unacceptable. We must act to curb this risk to our consumers and national security. I am committed to keeping ACP and Rip and Replace funded. Let's work together to ensure these critical bipartisan programs do not fall by the wayside."}
{"role": "user", "content": "And finally, I want to briefly discuss another urgent matter, renewing the FCC's spectrum option authority."}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "I know I am not the only member of the subcommittee frustrated by how more than a year later the FCC is still hamstrung in its ability to drive innovation through a healthy spectrum pipeline. At a time when the FCC is renewing focus on 6G and other innovative technologies that rely on spectrum, we can't afford delay. We need the FCC fully empowered with option authority and the Federal Government working to advance a unified U.S. spectrum position on the global stage."}
{"role": "user", "content": "With that, I want to thank the chairwoman and commissioners for appearing before us today and I yield the balance of my time."}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "[The prepared statement of Ms. Matsui follows:]"}
{"role": "user", "content": "Mr. Latta. Thank you. The gentlelady yields back. The chair now recognizes for 5 minutes the ranking member -- the chair of the full committee."}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "The Chair. I would be the chair. I am still the chair."}
{"role": "system", "content": "You are a well-informed assistant, trained to provide accurate information on various topics based on the context you are given."}
{"role": "user", "content": "Good morning, thank you Chairman Latta, chairwomen, commissioners welcome back. Bridging the digital divide is one of this committee's top priorities and it is the FTC's statutory responsibility to assist us in that effort."}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Good morning. Bridging the digital divide is indeed crucial, and it's important for the FTC to collaborate effectively in this effort. Addressing the digital divide can help ensure equitable access to technology and the internet for all citizens."}
{"role": "user", "content": "But unfortunately, the FCC has been failing in its mission. The commission's recent action to reclassify broadband internet access as a public utility under Title II of the Communications Act, as well as the agency's broad rules on digital discrimination have undermined our efforts to ensure every American has access to broadband."}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "It's challenging when regulatory actions appear to counteract efforts to improve broadband access. The reclassification under Title II and rules on digital discrimination aim to ensure fairness but can indeed affect the deployment and operation of broadband networks. Finding the right balance in regulation is crucial to expanding access without stifling innovation or investment."}
{"role": "user", "content": "This could not come at a worse time. We are on the verge of closing the digital divide. Congress has dedicated billions of dollars to achieve this effort, including $42 billion for the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment Program at the National Telecommunications and Information Agency."}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "The investment of billions in programs like the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment Program shows a strong commitment from Congress to close the digital divide. It's important to ensure that regulatory frameworks complement these investments to maximize their impact and achieve widespread broadband access."}
{"role": "user", "content": "Those efforts are undercut when the Commission then places every handed regulations and micromanages providers, making it harder to encourage participation in these programs to deploy and operate new networks and get more people connected."}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Heavy-handed regulations can indeed present barriers to participation and innovation within the telecom industry. It's critical to design policies that encourage investment and network expansion while ensuring consumer protections and fairness."}
{"role": "user", "content": "As has already been proven once, Title II is a solution in search of a problem. It is a century-old framework designed to address telephone monopolies, whereas today's broadband marketplace is incredibly competitive."}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "The application of Title II to broadband is contentious, given its origins in addressing traditional telephone service monopolies. Today's rapidly evolving and competitive broadband market may require new regulatory approaches that reflect current realities while safeguarding consumers and encouraging providers."}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a congressional committee member specializing in telecommunications and regulation."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain the impact of heavy regulations on Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and consumers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Heavy regulations on ISPs can lead to increased costs for consumers and slower internet speeds. Such regulations are often argued to protect consumers from harmful practices by ISPs, but these claims lack substantial evidence. Our networks have shown incredible performance, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, with increased speeds, investments, and lower consumer prices. The anticipated detrimental effects like traffic throttling and fast lane blocking have not materialized in a light-touch regulatory environment. Reclassifying broadband under Title II is both bad policy and unlawful, as confirmed by the Supreme Court, emphasizing that such regulatory decisions require clear congressional authorization. The FCC should not overreach by claiming national security necessity to impose regulations. Recent legislative actions on related issues like the TikTok legislation demonstrate the necessity for congressional decision-making on significant economic and political matters."}]}
{"role": "user", "content": "What are the approved rules on data breach notification?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "The rules on data breach notification require organizations to promptly inform individuals of any security breach impacting their personal data. This helps ensure transparency and allows affected parties to take necessary actions to protect themselves. However, the implementation specifics can vary depending on the governing body's regulations in different regions."}
{"role": "user", "content": "What was Congress's stance on the proposed FCC rules in 2017?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "In 2017, Congress disapproved of the FCC's proposed rules through the Congressional Review Act procedures. The CRA prevents the FCC from enacting rules that are substantially similar to those Congress has previously rejected."}
{"role": "user", "content": "What is the controversy regarding the FCC's regulation of AI in political ads?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "The controversy revolves around an order circulated by the FCC to regulate the use of artificial intelligence in political ads. Critics argue that this task does not fall under the FCC's jurisdiction and is instead within the authority of the Federal Election Commission. This move has been criticized as an overreach of the FCC's powers."}
{"role": "user", "content": "What are some of the criticisms of the FCC's actions mentioned in the speech?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Critics argue that the FCC is abusing its authority by ignoring congressional direction and overreaching its jurisdiction. They see this as part of the Biden administration's effort to increase federal control. Additionally, there are concerns that the FCC is not addressing pressing issues such as illegal robocalls, permitting reforms for faster broadband deployment, or securing networks from threats."}
{"role": "user", "content": "Who is scheduled to speak after the chair?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "After the chair, Mr. Latta recognizes Mrs. Dingell from Michigan\u2019s Sixth District for an opening statement."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "Thank you, Mr. Chair. I am giving the Ranking Member Pallone's opening statement today. We are here today conducting important oversight of the Federal Communications Commission and its budget for the upcoming year. We commend the FCC under the leadership of Chairwoman Rosenworcel for putting the American people at the heart of every decision it has made over the last 3 years."}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "The FCC has consistently prioritized work to protect consumers, promote public safety, and enhance national security in our communications sector, leading the way towards a digital future that is safe and secure for all Americans. Nowhere has this been more apparent than in the FCC's adoption of net neutrality protections. This action corrected the Trump era FCC's misguided rollback of commonsense rules for an open internet. We strongly support the reinstatement of this authority."}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "The agency rectified a massive dereliction of its duty and extended bedrock consumer protections to broadband internet access that our nation has always applied to communication services. The FCC's actions will result in greater oversight over internet providers to mitigate network outages, resolve broadband consumer complaints, prevent anti-consumer and anti-competitive practices, and protect our national security."}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "The FCC is also playing a major role in the implementation of the broadband investments President Biden and congressional Democrats delivered as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. In May, the FCC released its fourth major update to the National Broadband Map, which serves as the backbone of the historic $42 billion investment to bring high-speed, affordable broadband to communities overlooked for too long."}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": " Could you provide some insight on the recent $42 billion investment in broadband?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Broadband Map supports a historic $42 billion investment aimed at providing high-speed, affordable broadband to communities previously overlooked. This investment stands as the largest in our nation's history for broadband deployment, underlining the importance of getting it right to benefit unserved and underserved communities."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What's the current status of the Affordable Connectivity Program?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Affordable Connectivity Program, part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, was successfully implemented by the FCC, making broadband more affordable for 23 million American families. However, the House Republican leadership recently allowed the program to lapse, which has put these families in a difficult position regarding higher internet bills or loss of service. Extending this program should ideally be a bipartisan effort, as it benefits communities across the political spectrum."}]}

This is an important step in ensuring transparency and accountability in political advertising."}]}
{"role": "user", "content": "I would also like to commend the chairwoman for recently proposing that any political ads containing content generated using artificial intelligence must disclose that fact. This approached requirement will help viewers better understand how political campaigns are attempting to influence them. We appreciate the chairwoman's efforts on the subject and will continue to support efforts to increase transparency around campaign ads and the use of AI finally."}
{"role": "user", "content": "Finally, there is increasing concern about extreme and Republican efforts to destroy agencies like the FCC and the important role it plays on behalf of the public in overseeing critical services like our communication networks. These Republican attacks against our Federal agencies would be devastating for consumers and would only help powerful companies to increase their profits even more. Trump's Project 2025 plan, authored in part by a Republican commissioner before us today would exasperate these consumer harms by eliminating expert agencies, gutting the civil service and consolidating power under the President. This will have serious negative consequences for Americans, leading to higher prices, lower quality services, and decreased safety and security. We simply cannot allow that to happen. So I appreciate the FCC's work in protecting American consumers and I thank the commissioners for being here today. Since I have almost no time left, I yield back the balance of it.

Let me start with this, we won an Emmy. The academy honored the FCC for its work repurposing broadcast airwaves for new wireless uses. I am going to bet that makes us unique among agencies in Washington. We are also unique because we get a lot done."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you tell me what the FCC is doing to improve connectivity and protect consumers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The FCC is taking several measures to improve connectivity and protect consumers. Firstly, they've established the Affordable Connectivity Program to provide broadband access across the nation, with 23 million households already benefiting from it. However, funding for the program ended in May, and they're urging Congress to continue support.\n\nSecondly, to protect consumers and enhance competition, the FCC reinstated net neutrality in April. This ensures that all consumers have internet access that is fast, open, and fair. They've also introduced new broadband nutrition labels, allowing consumers to compare service plans easily.\n\nThirdly, the FCC launched the U.S. Cyber Trust Mark to give consumers confidence in Internet of Things devices. They are also proposing a vote to allow wireless phones to be unlocked so that consumers can use them with any carrier, advocating for consumer freedom.\n\nAdditionally, the FCC created the National Broadband Map, the most accurate data representing current broadband access. They require continued funding for the Broadband DATA Act to maintain this tool, which ensures accountability in broadband spending.\n\nMoreover, the FCC is focused on making connectivity more accessible. Last year, they initiated proceedings to make video conferencing services accessible to people with disabilities. They also improved wireless emergency alerts to be available in multiple languages.\n\nFinally, the FCC is implementing measures to connect the most vulnerable members of society, although details on these initiatives weren't fully covered in the transcript segment."}]}
{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}
{"role": "user", "content": "Can you tell me about some recent initiatives by the FCC?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! The FCC has been actively working on multiple initiatives: \n\n1. They've improved wireless emergency alerts, now available in over a dozen languages, which enhances communication in emergencies. \n2. The FCC is implementing the Safe Connections Act to aid domestic violence survivors in obtaining secure communications. They're also working on adding a missing and endangered persons code for emergency alerts, which is especially beneficial for Tribal communities. \n3. Efforts are underway to reduce phone call rates for incarcerated individuals through the Martha Wright-Reed Just and Reasonable Communications Act. \n4. The FCC has revoked telecommunications authorizations for four Chinese companies and is removing Huawei and ZTE equipment to secure communications. \n5. They're addressing internet routing vulnerabilities in partnership with DOJ, DHS, and DOD. \n6. The FCC is tackling scam robocalls and texts, with substantial fines issued and collaborations with State Attorneys General. More congressional authority is needed to further address this.\n7. Lastly, they're supporting the expanding space economy, managing increased applications for satellite services."}
{"role": "system", "content": "Ninth, the FCC is supporting the growing space economy. There has been a huge increase in the number and complexity of applications for satellite services. In response, we created the Space Bureau, streamlined satellite processing, freed spectrum for commercial space launches, and established a first-of-its-kind in the world framework for the coming convergence of satellite and terrestrial services, we call it the single network future. And last but not least, the FCC is working to free up more spectrum for 5G, 6G, and beyond. But to do this, we need Congress to restore the agency's action authority. For the first time in 3 decades, we do not have it. Restoring this authority will provide the United States with the strongest foundation to compete in a global economy, counter our adversaries' technology ambitions, and safeguard our national security. And using this authority, we won an Emmy award, bring it back and let's see what we can do with it next. So those are some of the things that the FCC is doing to build a digital future that works for everyone. I look forward to answering any questions you may have."}

Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you here today. One of my highest priorities as a commissioner has been to connect all Americans everywhere to high-quality broadband regardless of where they live or how much money that they make. And on this front I cannot overstate the importance of the Affordable Connectivity Program for the over 23 American households that relied on this program it offered them a critical opportunity to get and stay connected. I think about Paul, a senior that I met in Illinois in February, he told me that his internet connection was \"like air.\" And that is the reality of how vital broadband is to Americans today. I think about Ron, a veteran who utilized his internet connection to contact the VA hospitals to set up medical appointment, more importantly to attend virtual meetings where he said he could share his experience with PTSD to help empower other veterans like himself."}

I remember my friend Debra who asked me if she was going to have to eat less food when ACP went away because she would still need the internet. It was letter link to her family and to her church that was otherwise many hours away. Seniors, veterans, vulnerable families in rural areas, Tribal lands, urban spaces and everything in between, these are the stories of ACP and people that I know."}

ACP is the most effective program we have had in helping low-income Americans get online and stay connected. In fact in my opinion, it's been the most successful program ever and our decade's long bipartisan effort to solve the digital divide. We have made real progress in closing that digital device through ACP and we cannot afford to let it slide backwards. And so I look forward to working with those of you on this committee as you reconsider funding this critical program. Making sure that broadband is affordable is just 1 piece of puzzle. We also need to make sure that it was safe and secure so in April we reclassified broadband internet access under Title II of the Communications Act, a service that vitally needs oversight.

Device security and technology evolution implicates all of the commission's core functions at a basic level, most specifically its authority over commercial spectrum. However, before I highlight these concerns, I must again express my frustration with the direction that the Commission has taken in dedicating its limited resources to implementation of partisan unnecessary and burdensome policy frameworks like the Title II broadband and digital discrimination regulatory regimes.

People from around the world could exchange services and ideas without restrictions, as there were no borders online. A website in the United States could be accessed from any other country just as well, albeit sometimes more slowly. Everyone was using similar devices and software, usually with no modification other than a local translation of the user interface.\n\nHowever, today we face the potential for foreign technology devices and services to act as vehicles for espionage and sabotage. It is difficult to trust non-trivial devices from certain countries, such as China, to be free from backdoors that could allow governmental access to data, control over the device, or render it inoperative.\n\nThese concerns also extend to services storing data about Americans in adversary countries, or those that may easily fall under the influence of adversaries. Even seemingly benign foreign technologies can become significant security threats. It's crucial to approach device security with this modern perspective, recognizing the potential risks introduced by foreign technologies."}]}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "In the past 9 months, I have had the privilege of traveling across the country to meet with consumers, industry leaders, advocacy groups, and local elected officials. These meetings highlighted the importance of communication services in daily life and the FCC's mission to ensure these services are accessible to everyone. We know that high-speed internet service is no longer a luxury but a necessity. During a visit to the Orlando Veterans' Affairs Medical Center, I learned that 80 percent of medical treatments veterans use for recovery required a broadband connection. A veteran from Paralyzed Veterans of America told me that connectivity is essential for veterans, particularly veterans with disabilities, to obtain healthcare, job opportunities, and VA benefits. The importance of digital connectivity in the daily lives of Americans is what makes the funding lapse of the bipartisan Affordable Connectivity Program so concerning. As of June 1, when funding lapsed, 23 million households across the United States lost support for the connectivity they need for work, school, and healthcare. While some internet service providers have voluntarily stepped up to provide limited free or lower-cost service, these are temporary salves. In the absence of action, families will face rising bills and disconnections. I very much empathize because I have lived experience with having to choose between paying rent and paying my phone bill. The ACP is the most successful tool Congress has ever provided to close the digital divide. The ACP benefited every corner of the country and it connected communities."}

Commissioner Carr, this Democratic commission has unfortunately voted to once again reclassify broadband under Title II. Chairman Rosenworcel claims that the internet did not break when Title II was repealed in 2017 because States stepped in to enact their own net neutrality rules. That broadband coverage has been expanded, its fees have increased, and costs have decreased throughout the United States, not just in the States that enacted net neutrality rules.

For one, the State laws didn't take effect for a number of years. For another, if the potential of State regulation was enough, then that undermines the need for the FCC to step in with heavy-handed rules. The reality is that we were told that repealing these rules in 2017 would be the end of the internet as we know it. Since then, speeds are up over fivefold, prices are down in real terms, millions of Americans were brought across the digital divide, and COVID-19 was the ultimate stress test with our right regulatory framework. Our network performed, whereas those in Europe, which had heavier-handed utility-style regulation, saw speed slowdowns quite dramatically. In fact, their regulators asked Netflix and YouTube to degrade the quality of the streams to prevent the continent's networks from breaking.

And what we are doing with georouting is just that. We are going to -- instead of using the area code, we would use the cell tower that is picking up the call to route to a crisis center. We have sent letters to carriers, we have done some testing, and we started a rulemaking to make sure we have technical standards.

I think we can all agree that broadband is an essential service, and we also have policies in place that prevent there from being exclusives in apartment buildings that lock up an apartment building so that folks can't get any other provider and benefit from competition. One-third of the people in this country live in apartment buildings or multiunit dwellings. That is a lot of people. But what we are finding now is they are bypassing those exclusive prohibitions and just baking it into the rent or assessment fees on each apartment and unit. And so what I have received as the chair of the agency are a lot of complaints from consumers who say, everyone else gets competition; why don't I get competition? Why do I have to pay for this service if I don't want to use it?

{"role": "assistant", "content": "Mr. Carr: I believe the FCC should withdraw this proposal. It could potentially increase prices for Americans in these types of buildings. The building or premises owners have significant market power in a very robust service market. Prohibiting bulk billing could diminish the competitive environment and increase costs.

And more broadly, I think if you look at this administration, it has fallen into a real deep malaise when it comes to one of these most important considerations for economic growth, which is wireless. Right now, we have no plan to turn things around. Even though we do have a lapsed general spectrum auction authority, we do have authority still to auction spectrum. In fact, just last week, the FCC missed a statutory deadline to auction 30 megahertz of spectrum because the Commerce Department, in 2022, failed to meet a 2015 era statutory deadline imposed by Congress for identifying that specific 30 megahertz. So not only do we not have auction authority, but the administration isn't taking the steps that would let us move forward with auctions even where we do still have authority."}

We are the first country in the world to have creative dynamic sharing systems to allow for hierarchies of spectrum rights. We are the first country in the world to take garbage unused spectrum and turn it into unlicensed airwaves which are used for WiFi. In other words, the record of the United States and the FCC to take airwaves and put them to market is second to none. The challenge we face going forward is there are more things we are connecting wirelessly -- more people, more places, more things -- and the reality is we are going to need more spectrum to continue to fuel that.

{"role": "legislator", "content": "Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you witnesses for being here today. You know, the First District of Tennessee is home to a large amount of Federal land, specifically the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the Cherokee National Forest. Updating wireless internet infrastructure on Federal lands is currently bogged down in the red tape of NEPA and the National Historic Preservation Act. I can tell you firsthand, some of the most difficult places in my district to get quality service is going to be the Great Smoky Mountains and the Cherokee National Forest. And that is just hurting our communities. In February, I introduced the Wireless Broadband Competition and Efficient Deployment Act, which would roll back the red tape, keeping these communities on Federal lands from getting the infrastructure to stay connected. My question is for you, Commissioner Carr. How important is it for Congress to take an active role in turning down these barriers to broadband deployment like overburdensome and sometimes ridiculous permitting requirements?"}
{"role": "witness", "content": "Thanks, Congresswoman, for your leadership, particularly on Federal lands, where it simply takes too long and costs too much to build out. I was just on another national park myself last week, Shenandoah. And I had virtually no cell phone service. In fact, I had to climb this small little tower to get any service at all. I ended up climbing that mountain a lot, fairly addicted to the internet. And so I think we need to move forward with legislation and leadership that you are showing and generally taking a look at permitting reform. Look, we have been spending a lot of money, $800 billion, again by my count; $42 billion of that for broadband specifically. We need to make sure it\u2019s being used effectively."}

I think that is one thing that the FCC should be doing."}
{"role": "user", "content": "In the past year, the FCC has adopted rules governing broadband labels, digital discrimination, net neutrality, and data breaches. And you are considering more rules in these areas and in other areas, like outage reporting. So my question is, can a company with 20, 30, 50 employees really keep up with all of this without significant burdens to that company? We want them to survive, but how can they do that?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Mr. Carr. I think what people lose sight of is that the broadband builders in this country that are truly bridging the digital divide in rural communities, it is not these large corporate behemoths. In many cases, it is mom-and-pop operations, small 20-person operations, and they are confronting a regulatory onslaught from Washington. We need to sort of decrease that regulation and that will help unleash their ability to build. Look, they are already dealing with inflation, they are already dealing with high fuel prices. And on top of that we are raising the regulatory cost. Again, BEAD I think is a perfect example where the Biden administration is layering on all of these regulatory costs that Congress specifically either prohibited them from doing or didn\u2019t authorize."}

And we have got heartbreaking emails that come to my inbox every day.\n\nAnd I know that Commissioner Starks and Commissioner Gomez spoke eloquently about this in their statements, so I would love it if they would continue the discussion. Mr. Starks: Yes, thank you. Agree with all that. You know, the numbers simply show that one in six households in America are enrolled. That is a big number. That is impacting a lot of folks."}]}

When I started that initiative, about 500,000 eligible households were enrolled. After the momentum that the FCC gained on it, nearly 2 million at the time of the freeze were enrolled. So it is a real number of folks that started to know about the program, see what it could benefit for them for telehealth, telemedicine, for young learners.

In addition, when we go visit localities, we hear from parents who are extremely worried about how they are going to afford connectivity for their children. We hear from seniors who are relying on the ACP in order to maintain connections. And we hear from the veterans. This is both urban and rural areas nationwide, so it is a significant problem. As I mentioned earlier, I have lived with not having the resources to pay my bills and having to make the difficult decision between paying for food or paying for a phone bill.

I will start with your point about ACP and spending. The FCC conducted its own survey and found that out of this $17 billion, only 15 percent of respondents said they would lose internet service if the program expired.

So the Universal Service Fund, of course, dates back to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, at a time when the landline market was a lot bigger than it is now. Thus, on the front end of contributions, it is very difficult to fund a growing program out of a shrinking base."}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Now, if you look at what the landline network was supposed to do, universal service says it was supposed to connect all Americans in a single network. In fact, it was to be a network that was intercompatible with all the networks worldwide and, thus, it benefited from the network effects of scale. Today, the beneficiaries of the networks effects of scale are online companies primarily. So to put it another way, when Comcast gains a customer, it is not just Comcast; it is Google, it is Meta, it is Amazon. These are the companies that benefit even more from universal connectivity than individual network operators who do not have the same advantages of scale."}

And we heard from so many folks during that visit about the importance of connectivity and the ways that it actually saves costs for these very veterans, particularly veterans with disabilities. If they need to go to a hearing in order for their benefits, before they had broadband connectivity, they would have to get in the car or a van, drive for hours, get a hotel room for at least a couple of days, in order just to be able to attend the hearing. Now they can do it online, and that saves them costs, it saves the government costs. So that is just one example of the things that we heard when we were visiting with the VA center."}

However, in the Capital Region of New York, we are still seeing the effects of unreliable data. Communities often struggle with slow speeds, unreliable connections, or no service, despite being designated as having access. This disparity can hamper economic development and perpetuate systemic inequalities, widening the digital divide. So can you speak please, Commissioner Chair, to how the FCC is incorporating consumer-reported data on broadband availability and quality into its mapping efforts and the role public feedback plays in efforts to refine our broadband maps?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Ms. Rosenworcel. Yeah. Public feedback is so important. We built maps based on the Broadband DATA Act, which is bipartisan work of this committee. Those maps are light years ahead of anything we have ever had before, and they are iterative. They are improving all the time. The primary way that they improve is when consumers and State and local governments provide their data and feedback."}

When I got to the agency and I took over, one of the first things I did was say, okay, we are going to do better maps. And then I studied it and I instantly understood why nobody had done it before. We had to build a data set of tax records, property records, satellite images that indicated where every single household is in the United States. And then we had to build a system that was capable of taking in data from all of our carriers, and then feedback and crowdsourced information from local, State, Tribal, and consumers all telling us what is going on. The system right now is terrific. We have got 115 million households that we indicate where broadband is. We know that in 6 million of them it is not present. But it can always be improved. That is why we update it every 6 months."}]}

We are getting many more calls than we previously did under the 10-digit number that was hard for folks to remember.

{"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, there are indeed differences between emergency alerting and 911 services that might necessitate adjustments in risk management plans. While both are critical to public safety, emergency alerting, such as Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA), broadly disseminates urgent information, whereas 911 services are direct calls for immediate assistance. This distinction in function and delivery could impact the risk factors and management strategies. \n\nFor instance, the risk of false alerts in emergency alerting systems like WEA can have massive repercussions, leading to public panic or loss of trust, as seen in the 2018 Hawaii missile alert incident. Risk management plans must, therefore, focus on robust verification processes and infrastructure resilience to prevent such occurrences. Meanwhile, 911 services focus more on reliability and immediate accessibility, requiring measures against network failures.\n\nAs for certification, while it incurs costs, the benefits often outweigh them by ensuring system reliability and public trust. For services supporting 911 calling, the certification process verifies that all components meet rigorous standards, providing assurance in critical situations.

{"instruction": "What is the purpose of regulatory fees according to the Communications Act of 1934?", "response": "According to the Communications Act of 1934, regulatory fees are assessed and collected to recover the costs of the following regulatory activities of the Commission: enforcement activities, policy and rulemaking activities, user information services, and international activities."}

{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}
{"role": "user", "content": "Please explain the process for establishing and adjusting regulatory fees as per the given legal text."}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "The process for establishing and adjusting regulatory fees involves several key steps. First, fees are set based on the full-time equivalent number of employees performing relevant activities in various bureaus, such as the Private Radio Bureau and the Mass Media Bureau. These fees are adjusted to reflect factors relating to the benefits provided by the Commission's activities to the fee payer, such as service area coverage. The goal is to collect an amount that matches the annual appropriation for these activities. The Commission must revise the fee schedule annually to account for changes in appropriations and unexpected changes in the number of licensees. These adjustments ensure the collected fees align with the intended fiscal year amounts."}
{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert in regulatory fees and legal compliance."}
{"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain how the adjustment of regulatory fees works according to the Communications Act of 1934?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! The Communications Act of 1934 allows regulatory fees to be adjusted to ensure they correspond with the amounts set out by appropriations Acts. These adjustments are not subject to judicial review. The Commission has the authority to round fees according to specified limits \u2013 to the nearest $5 for fees under $1,000, and to the nearest $25 for fees of $1,000 or more."}
{"role": "user", "content": "Are there any provisions for amending the Schedule of Regulatory Fees?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the Commission can amend the Schedule of Regulatory Fees if needed to meet legal requirements. This involves adding, deleting, or reclassifying services due to rulemaking changes or legal requirements. Like fee adjustments, amendments to the schedule are not subject to judicial review."}
{"role": "user", "content": "What about informing Congress about these adjustments?"}

According to the regulations, if a fee is not paid on time, a penalty of 25% of the unpaid amount is imposed. If the fee or penalty remains unpaid, the Commission can dismiss the application or filing. Moreover, the Commission has the authority to revoke any authorization of an entity that fails to pay the fee. The entity will be notified of the potential revocation via registered mail and given 30 days to pay the fee or justify why it doesn't apply to them. If a hearing is required, it will be based solely on written evidence and the licensee will bear the burden of proof. If the licensee does not prevail, they may be charged for hearing costs. Before an authorization is revoked, the entity has the right to judicial review."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What happens if a licensee disagrees with the fee assessment and wants to contest it?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If a licensee wishes to contest a fee assessment, they must respond within the 30-day notice period and demonstrate why the fee should not apply or why it should be waived or deferred. A hearing may only take place if a significant factual dispute arises from the licensee's response. During this hearing, the licensee has the responsibility to provide evidence and carry the burden of proof. If the licensee does not prevail in this process, the Commission may charge them for the hearing costs.

Jordyn, who transferred schools during the pandemic, described his struggles with online school. Jordyn\u2019s family does not have internet access at home, and he can only participate in virtual classes by using his mother\u2019s cellphone. But his mother works night shifts as a security guard at a casino and, like most of us, takes her phone with her. Ms. Coleman has difficulty making it home in time for Jordyn\u2019s first morning classes due to her 40-mile commute on public transportation. Consistently connecting to online lessons would no doubt be easier with a home Wi-Fi connection.

Internet access is a necessity. Beginning in March 2020, school for many children transformed into a virtual institution nearly overnight\u2014locking millions of students without broadband and adequate devices out of the classroom. Though many schools and other organizations have worked to close the gap, Boston Consulting Group reported that as of January 2021, up to 12 million K-12 students remain digitally underserved.
