APTs, like the Stuxnet attack in 2010 and the Triton attack in 2017, persist until they breach their target's defenses. Traditional methods relying on indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as hash values, IP addresses, and attack tools can provide insights into individual attacks but fall short in capturing the overall behavior, tactics, and techniques of APTs. Without a comprehensive understanding of an APT's modus operandi, there is a risk of mistaking them for other cyberattacks, potentially leading to false alarms.

One approach is using databases to find known APT attacks, though this won't help in identifying new attack patterns. Structural or white-box techniques require knowledge of a network's internal structure, including details on hardware, software, and vulnerabilities. They are less commonly used due to the complexity and overhead in integrating different components like asset information and network topology. Third-party integration is also challenging if internal asset management systems are already in place. Causal correlation, on the other hand, doesn't require node-related specifics but instead focuses on previous events, such as vulnerabilities exploited and privileges gained, to detect APTs.

The second stage focuses on gaining remote access to the company's network. The final stages address the attacker’s ultimate goals, like data theft or system disruption, often occurring in the last phases of the attack model. Understanding these stages is critical as it helps predict the attacker’s goals and next moves. These models reflect entry methods such as weaponization or installation, and objectives like reconnaissance or actions. However, the models can be disrupted if unanticipated actions occur, meaning attackers may deviate from well-known techniques. For instance, the APT Stuxnet can operate independently without communicating through a C&C server.

By analyzing APT attack-related behaviors, we can identify their unique intentions, which aids in distinguishing APTs from other types of threats. Our systematic literature review showed that APTs use different attack vectors comprising tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) tailored to the target network's environment. Although these TTPs have commonalities, they can be grouped for better understanding, as depicted in frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK. MITRE ATT&CK provides extensive knowledge based on real-world adversary tactics and techniques, widely utilized for developing threat models in various sectors.

For instance, in the reconnaissance phase, APT 1 and APT 3 share the same TTPs, such as spear phishing emails. A comprehensive threat profile can be generated to describe a specific APT attack, illustrating that such attacks are executed in stages.
