Experts have noted that the app uses hard-coded encryption keys and sends unencrypted user and device data to Chinese companies. These design choices raise significant concerns. The mobile security firm NowSecure recommended removing the app from environments due to these risks. Additionally, significant data collection about the user's device further suggests potential privacy issues."}]}

The combination of device information, the user's Internet address, and data from mobile advertising companies could de-anonymize users. NowSecure found that the app communicates with Volcengine, a cloud platform by ByteDance, though the extent of data sharing isn't fully clear. More concerning is that the app transmits device information without encryption, making it vulnerable to interception and modification. The app also disables iOS's App Transport Security, leading to unencrypted data transmission. Although some server responses are encrypted, they use the insecure and deprecated 3DES algorithm, with hard-coded encryption keys, posing further security risks."}]}

U.S. congressional offices have been warned against using the app, and security measures have been implemented to restrict its functionality on House-issued devices. Italy, Taiwan, the Pentagon, NASA, and the U.S. Navy have all taken steps to ban or restrict the app due to these concerns. Additionally, researchers have found a publicly accessible database linked to DeepSeek containing sensitive data."}]}

The report card for Deepseek reflects high aptitude and achievement, both graded at A+, indicating strong cognitive and creative abilities. However, the diligence score of B- suggests there may be some inconsistency in steady effort or time management. Deepseek has been noted for not always adhering to conventional methods, which can be a double-edged sword in innovation-driven fields. The significant 'Impact' score set at A++++++++ highlights an extraordinary influence, possibly indicating how Deepseekâ€™s work stands out in his field. Furthermore, despite any diligence concerns, his recent project, although hurried, was appreciated for its openness, suggesting a potential for collaborative learning among peers. This marks Deepseek as a promising individual with the potential to inspire others and contribute valuable insights in the upcoming year."}]}
