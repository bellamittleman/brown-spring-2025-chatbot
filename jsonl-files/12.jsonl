These phishing attempts often spoof services like the U.S. Postal Service or local toll road operators to trick users into submitting their payment information. Once the criminals have this data, they can load it into mobile wallets to make online purchases or use it in stores. This technique allows them to bypass traditional security measures implemented by chip-based payment systems."}]}

If the victim provides the code, phishers can then link the card data to a new mobile wallet, which they control. These criminals often load multiple stolen digital wallets onto a single device and sell the phones in bulk. Security researcher Ford Merrill has documented Chinese smishing gangs using video tutorials to teach these methods. One promotional video even showed stacks of phones for sale, each loaded with several digital wallets."}]}

Initially, there was a waiting period of 60 to 90 days before using stolen phones for fraud, but now it's merely seven to ten days. Additionally, criminals can cash out by using real point-of-sale terminals and employing tap-to-pay on numerous phones or utilizing mobile fraud technology like an Android app called 'ZNFC' that can relay valid NFC transactions globally. This app is available for $500 a month and includes 24-hour support."}]}

It involves the use of mobile wallet and NFC attacks primarily conducted by organized crime gangs, particularly in Europe. These groups use sophisticated methods to withdraw money from ATMs using smartphones, and various groups around the world have adopted similar methods. In Singapore, authorities arrested foreign individuals who used ghost tap apps to make unauthorized purchases, illustrating the global and diverse nature of these criminal activities. Advanced phishing techniques often power these operations, allowing criminals to efficiently extract victim data for their schemes."}]}

One innovation they use is to capture anything typed into the data fields in real-time, which allows them to log sensitive information even if the visitor decides not to click the 'submit' button. This means that as soon as the would-be victim enters their personal or financial information, it is recorded and can then be stored or forwarded to databases controlled by the phishers."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an investigative journalist focusing on cybersecurity and fraud prevention strategies."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain how phishing schemes are using mobile wallet provisioning to their advantage?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Phishing schemes have become increasingly sophisticated, particularly in the realm of mobile wallet provisioning. These scams often originate from smishing—SMS phishing—websites that are managed by real human operators. These operators typically send a small batch of phishing messages at a time, as the process involves manual intervention, often from operators based in China.\n\nOne-time codes used in mobile wallet provisioning are generally only valid for a short duration. To exploit this, phishing sites often require the visitor to access the site through a mobile device to facilitate the capture of these codes. This not only ensures the device being used is the same that will receive the code, but it also reduces the chances of the victim leaving the site.\n\nFurthermore, some phishing kits from China have developed an innovative method of transforming stolen card details into digital images resembling real payment cards from victims' financial institutions. This facilitates the fraudulent enrollment of these cards into Apple Pay or similar services, as it becomes as simple as scanning the created card image with a device such as an iPhone. This technological progression significantly lowers the barrier for cybercriminals in executing their scams."}]}

When these are scanned into mobile wallets like Apple Pay, the app attempts to verify ownership by sending a one-time code. Identifying vulnerabilities in popular phishing platforms, researchers have exposed the scale of this issue. For instance, a group known as the Smishing Triad was found to have harvested over 100,000 payment cards from various phishing domains. Losses per card vary, but are estimated to range from $100 to $500 when used illicitly in mobile wallets. Overall, these activities result in substantial financial damage, with estimates around $15 billion in fraudulent charges over a single year."}]} 
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI assistant specializing in cybersecurity and financial fraud prevention."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How does phished data end up being used in mobile wallets for fraud, and what are financial institutions doing to combat this?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The fraud process typically involves phishing kits that acquire victim card data, which is then used for fraudulent charges. The reliance on one-time SMS codes for linking payment cards to mobile wallets has been exploited by phishers. Financial institutions have been caught off guard by the volume of fraud due to the lag between data phishing and its use. Many institutions are still trying to identify the causes of their losses, despite tokenization processes being in place. Continuous updates to the vulnerabilities used by phishers make it challenging to maintain security. Efforts to combat this include enhancing authentication protocols and increasing awareness of phishing tactics among consumers."}]}

Some banks in Europe and Asia now require customers to log into their bank's mobile app before linking a digital wallet, improving security. However, addressing the threat of 'ghost taps' where NFC transactions are relayed from another device may need updates to contactless payment terminals which could be costly and delayed due to the terminals' lifespan. Moreover, Apple and Google could play a crucial role by monitoring unusual wallet additions on devices and recommending stronger authentication methods for mobile wallet provisioning."}]}

This process allows the attacker to make unauthorized transactions using the victim’s financial information. The article emphasizes the importance of being vigilant with emails and messages that ask for personal information, as well as using multifactor authentication to secure accounts."}]}
