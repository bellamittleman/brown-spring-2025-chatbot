This has led to a patchwork of differing requirements that can be duplicative, overlapping, or even contradictory. Such diversity creates compliance challenges for regulated entities, which must navigate these differences, and for regulators developing new enforcement standards. Consequently, these complexities may detract from achieving overarching cybersecurity objectives by dividing attention and resources. To address this, the 2023 National Cybersecurity Strategy emphasizes the need to harmonize and streamline regulations to better defend critical infrastructure."}]}

Another concern is that harmonization might enforce a one-size-fits-all approach, overlooking the unique threat models and risk profiles of different industries. Tailored standards are necessary, as noted by the Aerospace Industries Association, to manage risks efficiently in their specific operational environments. The Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD) addresses these concerns by suggesting a tiered approach, allowing sector-specific deviations from baseline requirements to address unique risks."}]}

They need to decide which types of events to include, such as acts of unauthorized access, incidents jeopardizing confidentiality, integrity, or availability of systems, or violations of security policies. Furthermore, they must determine the level of certainty required to trigger a reporting obligation, ranging from an incident that definitely occurred to potential or imminent threats.

One key difference is whether personal data must be nonpublic or can be any information linked to an individual. Sector-specific regulations like FERPA, HIPAA, the FTC, and FCC rules on CPNI have tailored definitions for their industries. For example, the FCC considers location and call data as requiring protection, which may not be relevant in other contexts.

Encryption requirements can differ significantly across various regulations. For example, regulations like PCI DSS and EPA emphasize encryption during data transit, while others like NY DFS and FTC Safeguards require encryption both at rest and in motion. Additionally, the types of data to be encrypted can vary: PCI DSS focuses on 'sensitive cardholder data,' FTC on 'customer information,' HIPAA on 'electronic protected health information,' and NY DFS on 'nonpublic information.' The FDA, on the other hand, requires encryption for any data whose compromise could result in patient harm, focusing on potential risks rather than specific data types. There's also a need for harmonization of encryption standards, where some regulations specify protocols like TLS and SSL, and others, like FedRAMP, require cryptographic modules validated by standards like FIPS 140."}]}

Current regulations don't mandate specific encryption algorithms or key lengths, but require the use of cryptographic modules validated by FIPS 140 or approved by the NSA via the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP). This allows for regular updates as new modules are developed but can impose a compliance burden on firms needing CMVP approval for new methods.\n\nOpportunities for harmonization include defining what data types must be encrypted and when, and standardizing encryption protections across sectors. Two key questions arise: (1) Should encryption be applied to all personal/sensitive data both in motion and at rest? (2) Which types of encryption are adequate for data protection?

Similarly, EPA recommendations for public water systems suggest allowing connections to the Operational Technology (OT) network from the Information Technology (IT) network only via approved means and default to deny all unidentified connections.

As noted by Red Alert Labs, electric utilities with medium and high impact assets have to self-certify compliance annually and undergo onsite audits every 3-6 years. However, due to the vast number of cybersecurity requirements, these audits often can't cover all provisions comprehensively. Standardization can streamline the process, allowing audits to be more thorough by reducing the number of unchecked requirements. Similarly, harmonizing provisions related to incident response plans, logging policies, patching requirements, and continuous monitoring can clarify expectations and simplify audits. However, vague requirements can complicate the auditing process, as auditors might interpret them differentially, leading to inconsistent findings across organizations. Harmonizing baseline security requirements across regulations can improve audit consistency and clarity."}]}

In contrast, the CFTC System Safeguards Rule mandates that reporting be done 'promptly' without specifying a strict timeline. The National Defense Industry Association has pointed out timelines as short as 8 hours, such as in the FAR Case 2021-017, and others being 24 to 72 hours.

In contrast, the SEC proposed a four-day timeline for businesses to disclose material cybersecurity incidents via Form 8-K. The variation in these timelines, ranging from 24 hours to four days, has led to calls for harmonization to avoid confusion and reduce the compliance burden.

This office would help establish consensus standards for cybersecurity regulations. Once such a framework is established, government agencies issuing federal cybersecurity requirements would need to align them with existing consensus standards or justify any divergences.
