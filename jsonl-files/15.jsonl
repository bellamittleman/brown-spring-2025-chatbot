Internet governance, being a form of information policy, is crucial because it provides the framework for this context through the Internet—considered a 'pan-medium.' Historically, distinct technologies were governed by different laws, but the Internet serves as a unifying infrastructure for all forms of communication. As we face challenges to the rule of law globally, Internet governance research must consider the implications of internet uses and the socio-technical decisions shaping governance and metagovernance."}]}

These technologies blur the lines between agency and structure, often allowing for a choice between the two. This shift has significant implications for areas like Internet governance and intellectual property rights, where manufacturers can choose between software or hardware and rely on copyright or patent for protection. Furthermore, the concept of network daemons highlights the latent potentialities of networks, often unseen by users, which only become active in specific conditions, steering us towards a user-oriented approach to technology."}]}

It's relevant to Internet governance because local manifestations of infrastructure can denote governance dynamics. Regime theory suggests that private sectors play a role in policy analysis openly rather than critically. Historical involvement, such as international law firms in the 1980s working on transnational digital information flows, highlights this. When applied to Internet governance, it could help in understanding the formation and transformation of governance structures across different levels."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do institutions impede or encourage learning in the context of regime theory?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Institutions can both impede and encourage learning within regime theory. They encourage learning by providing a structured environment where rules and regulations are created, tested, and adapted over time. However, these same structures can also impede learning if they are too rigid, failing to adapt quickly to sudden or radical changes. This is particularly relevant in contexts where the rule of law has collapsed, or where governance is in a state of evolution or transition."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain regime theory in relation to Internet governance?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Regime theory in Internet governance involves the structured management of the Internet under conditions of change. Governance can be manifested through laws, agreements, and shared norms. While regime theorists often expect gradual change, Internet governance must also contend with rapid shifts and turbulent conditions.

It involves exploring which historical narratives are prioritized. A foundational question in network neutrality discussions, particularly in the U.S., revolves around these narratives. Ithiel de Sola Pool's 'Technologies of Freedom' (1983) suggests that as legal systems converge due to technology convergence, repressive features may prevail. The U.S. had distinct regulatory systems by the time technology advanced, impacting how digital communication is governed.

According to Abbate (2017), how Internet governance is defined is a political decision, guided by the ideologies of those in power. The technologies involved often embed political values and can be manipulated for political ends, rather than strictly for governance (DeNardis 2012). As different countries and organizations shape these narratives, it is essential to consider diverse historical and theoretical perspectives to enrich policy analyses and address similar issues across different domains more effectively."}]}

As our digital landscape evolves, the application of free speech analyses has expanded to include digital information collection, processing, and flow issues. The recognition of software as a form of speech has been a topic of discussion for decades and is now extending to autonomous digital entities such as robots. These analyses are crucial not only in debates about potential citizenship status for digital agents but also for understanding the broad implications of digital communication. To effectively govern these technologies, we need to consider media policy in terms of public nature, discussing shared matters of concern, and access to information to frame the conditions of public discourse, as originally suggested by Braman in 2004. However, as we advance, additional dimensions must be integrated into the evaluation of design decisions, regulations, and content policies within the context of Internet governance."}]}

This approach suggests that creating new 'realities' through decisive actions redefines the environment within which researchers, courts, and other rational actors must operate. Rove implies that political power can transcend traditional boundaries of factual analysis, contrasting the notion of a 'reality-based community' that relies on studying discernible facts to find solutions. This perspective has implications for governance, suggesting that perceived successes or failures may depend on controlling these narratives and the spatiotemporal frameworks of various dilemmas, as noted by theorists like Jessop."}]}

These can be seen as byproducts of governance structures initially necessary but now possibly manipulated for aesthetic or operational aims. Scholars such as Braman (2006) suggest that these spandrels can make governance actions appear desirable, whereas in reality, they might serve other functions for producers. This concept is part of a broader discussion about the evolution of state nature since the 1970s. Bevir and Rhodes (2011) identify three streams within this literature, focusing on the networked state model that emerged by the late 1980s, where states can no longer wield unilateral power due to intertwined governance interactions, and metagovernance, which explores how states continue to manage within this context."}]}

One perspective, metagovernance, examines how the state manages diverse processes to exert control. Another theory focuses on 'decentered governance', where governance is seen more in the hands of individuals and elites, moving away from bureaucratic state control. Jessop (2004) refers to this as governing in the 'shadow of government', while Bovaird (2005) calls it 'governance without government'. Bevir and Rhodes (2011) describe it as the 'stateless state'. These theories suggest a diminished state effectiveness in certain areas, especially concerning the Internet, which Braman (2015) argues might be beyond traditional governance capabilities."}]}

According to an OECD report, governance involves 'concertation', which is the effort to manage diverse and distributed elements across social structures and geographies. Effective management in complex systems is often seen as impossible without recognizing inherent limits. Theoretical work in governance is emphasized but it also faces limits. Recognizing these limits led Jessop (2011) to advocate for 'requisite irony' in metagovernance.

It constantly reminds us to consider the interactions among different decisions and policies. It offers a unique perspective on complex interactions among numerous policy issues and serves as an umbrella for various types of decision-making venues, processes, stakeholders, and effects.

As DeNardis describes, laws and regulations by states are 'bordered policy,' with boundaries that may not align with network boundaries. Internet governance often requires reconciling national security and Internet security, leading to a divergence and convergence of these issues. Further complicating matters, theorists like Jessop argue that conceptualizations of the state are core to its modern form, influencing governance and metagovernance. The linguistic frameworks used to discuss and define the state help shape its practices and nature. This influence is observed in the work of Hofmann and activists like ten Oever and Milan, who explore how organizational structures and decision-making processes serve rhetorical functions in governance."}]}

Initially, these principles were reflected in treaties concerning postal systems and semaphore networks. These treaties mandated the exchange of network architecture and addressing information, data retention, message authentication, and filtering of harmful content. By the 1980s, discussions within RFCs began to include legal aspects, raising questions about the geopolitical implications of networks. A crucial aspect was the 'rights to cut off,' now known as the 'Internet kill switch,' which allowed governments to sever connections to protect national security or maintain public order. These principles have evolved to address current concerns about communications security within international legal frameworks."}]}

Rutkowski (2011) highlighted the processes and significant efforts involved in collecting pertinent documents from various institutional sources and converting them into a digital format for analysis. By doing so, he demonstrated the importance of transparency and accessibility in research. Publicizing such methods encourages others to adopt similar practices, which can be beneficial in other areas of Internet governance research.

Traditionally, these borders were conceptual and subject to negotiation, which played a significant role in national decisions about regulating the converged technological environment, especially with digitization. International treaties about electronic networks introduce further complexity. For instance, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 suggests a new principle: states have the right not to know about the data transiting their networks, preventing them from needing to react in potentially detrimental ways. This illustrates the limits states face, particularly regarding cybersecurity, where an act is of concern only if it involves or targets the state.

There is often a disconnect between technical solutions and political, social, or legal realities. The Internet is intertwined with other processes and the broader environment, making it increasingly difficult to isolate and govern as a distinct entity. Political systems once thought stable are proving inadequate for continuous societal shifts. Thus, Internet governance research is itself a challenge of metagovernance. Scholars like Sandra Braman argue that regardless of the Internet's existence as a legal subject, there remains a conceptual right to govern or assume governance. The academic pursuit involves various 'ologies,' including epistemology, methodology, and deontology."}]}

Johnson and David G. Post explored the concept of cyberspace as a distinct jurisdiction. They, along with others such as Tim Wu, did not use the term \"Internet governance\" but discussed cyberspace law and customs. The idea was to treat the whole of cyberspace as a separate jurisdiction, which led to propositions like multistakeholder collaboration and the establishment of a world cyber court. These discussions emphasized the sovereignty of cyberspace itself, separate from the sovereignty of states. The formation of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) later helped formalize and cement the term \"Internet governance.\" Legal scholars also tackled new issues arising from the commercialization of the Internet, such as trademark law related to domain names, intermediary responsibility in copyright protection, and censorship and filtering of internet content."}]}

Some argued that cyberlaw was merely an extension of existing legal principles, dismissing it as akin to the 'law of the horse,' suggesting it was too niche to derive unifying principles from (Easterbrook 1996). However, this view underestimated the transformative impact of technology on societal interactions and legal institutions. The debate evolved into a broader discussion about the sociology of technology, with scholars examining how Internet technology and societal factors influenced each other.

It was recognized as a new form of governance born from the networked age. Initially, it was seen as an innovative paradigm, but it also faced challenges concerning its legality and legitimacy. As a private nonprofit corporation, ICANN was controversially given authority by the U.S. to manage the global domain name and Internet address space, thereby addressing public policy issues via private contracts. This included dealing with competition policy, domain-name trademark disputes, and internet address allocations. Another notable aspect of ICANN was its early attempts at using global elections to ensure board accountability, which raised discussions on governance and sovereignty."}]}

Van Eeten and Mueller (2013) questioned whether forums like the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) truly represent Internet governance or are merely discussion platforms. Hofmann, Katzenbach, and Gollack (2016) contributed to this debate by distinguishing between governance and regulation. The dynamic nature of Internet governance is evident in the process of institutional isomorphism, where national and regional forums replicate the IGF's approach. Epstein and Nonnecke (2016) noted a distinction between substantive and performative multistakeholder governance, with regional forums potentially linking the UN IGF to local rulemaking. This debate also intersects with broader discussions about the influence of states and the emergence of new governance forms, as highlighted by Goldsmith and Wu (2006)."}]}

The total average cost for firms dealing with data breaches rose from $3.13 million in 2011 to approximately $3.86 million in 2017. Trends in cost seem to parallel the frequency of incidents. The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse reports that the number of data breaches in the U.S. increased from 136 cases in 2005 to 832 cases in 2016. In terms of compromised records, the number rose dramatically from 55 million in 2005 to 4.6 billion in 2016, partially due to significant cases like the 2013 Yahoo! breach involving 1 billion users.

While some argue, citing figures like former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge, that the impacts of a cyberattack could be more severe than physical attacks, there is also a suggestion that our perceptions might overstate the issue. Research by Anderson and his colleagues challenges the idea that cybercrime costs trillions of dollars, instead suggesting that direct losses to victims are a smaller fraction of the broader social costs, which cannot be fully translated into financial terms for cybercriminals. The study points out that while the destruction caused by cybercrime may be substantial, the profits gained by criminals can be comparatively small.

A study by Herley and Florêncio in 2009 highlighted that many estimates of the high value of phishing for attackers, sometimes suggesting earnings in the thousands of dollars per day, are likely inaccurate. They argue that as phishing targets a common pool resource (users' wallets), the benefits decrease as more attackers join the fray, reducing earnings to something comparable to what their skills could earn them legally. In 2008, phishers likely shared a $61 million pot across 113,000 individuals, averaging about $540 each. Despite these modest earnings for criminals, the social cost is enormous, with billions spent on defense and remediation. This disparity indicates that while the financial gains for cybercriminals might be overstated, the societal costs of phishing are significant."}]}

As detailed, the sample has grown both in the number of countries and firms studied, increasing from 8 countries and 199 firms in 2011 to 19 countries and 477 firms in 2017. While this expanded sample offers broader coverage, it introduces biases in trend data as new, potentially high-target samples are added. For example, adding countries or firms from highly targeted industries like finance or healthcare can skew averages upward, suggesting worsening trends even if the majority of the sample shows no such increase.

It could be due to higher costs per firm or the inclusion of new actors with higher average costs. The law of large numbers suggests stability in averages over a large sample size. However, stable means occur mainly in a Gaussian distribution.

In some countries, there are no mandatory data breach disclosure regulations, allowing firms to avoid public disclosure. Additionally, companies might fear reputational damage or financial consequences, which could deter them from reporting incidents. Furthermore, there is an issue with the availability of cybersecurity loss data, which complicates risk pricing and necessitates innovative actuarial models. It's also possible that the production of cybersecurity metrics is influenced by vested interests, such as IT security vendors, whose reports may be biased due to a conflict of interest between research and marketing."}]}

First, different methodological and pragmatic biases can cloud our understanding. These biases include missing evidence, shifting samples, extreme distribution types, and under- and overreporting of statistics. Additionally, changes in the internet's scale and demographic constitution have not been well accounted for in cybersecurity metrics. In the analogue world, insecurity or crime is often expressed as a rate per 100,000 people, which helps adjust for population size variations. However, with the rapidly growing internet, the failure to adjust metrics for the ecosystem's size can result in biased and misleading statistics like raw counts of breached records."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI assistant specializing in cybersecurity metrics and analysis."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain the potential issues with measuring cybersecurity through breach counts and rates?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Measuring cybersecurity using only breach counts or rates can be misleading because the ecosystem's size may affect these metrics. For instance, if the size of the ecosystem grows significantly, the number of records breached might diverge from the rate of records breached per 100,000 users. This might lead to conflicting interpretations where counts suggest worsening cybersecurity while rates imply improvement. For example, comparing the Anti-Phishing Working Group's reports from 2008 to 2016 shows an increase in phishing websites. However, due to advances in browser security like low latency blacklisting, more phishing sites don't necessarily equate to increased insecurity. The growth of Internet size must be considered when evaluating such metrics."}]}

When evaluating the impact of phishing websites, it's important to differentiate between total counts and rates. Total counts alone might show an increase in phishing websites, suggesting more insecurity online. However, when normalized by measuring rates per 100 websites or per 1 million Google searches, we get a better contextual understanding of the trend relative to overall online activity. For instance, despite an increase in total phishing sites, a decline in these rates indicates that the proportional presence of phishing sites and possibly their exposure to users is decreasing. This implies that while there are more sites, the growth of the web and search activity may outpace them, or improved safety measures could be contributing to a relatively more secure internet environment."}]}

Although the absolute number of phishing websites is increasing, the overall growth of the internet (as a platform for all websites or the number of online activities like Google searches) is outpacing this rise. Consequently, the likelihood of encountering a phishing site during typical online activities is decreasing. When measuring cybersecurity, focusing on rates—which account for the growth of the internet ecosystem—provides a more favorable viewpoint than absolute counts. This perspective helps to illustrate that, despite rising numbers, the security landscape is improving in certain respects. The interpretation of security trends using rates may present a more optimistic scenario in terms of exposure risk compared to purely count-based assessments, which may suggest a different reality."}]}

This means that states must take steps to prevent, investigate, punish, and redress any human rights abuses that arise from the practices of private companies. Human rights law aims to protect individuals from abuse by power, addressing power imbalances. Thus, there are often conflicting interests in human rights protection, such as the conflict between user privacy rights and business models based on data harvesting, or between freedom of expression and terms of service enforcement by companies. While it is necessary to critically examine the human rights impact of private companies, one must also be realistic about the economic interests involved and the limits of achieving voluntary commitments from these companies. Nonetheless, there is an increasing trend of cooperation and funding from technology companies for advocacy, policy, and research in human rights areas. It is essential to address both the binding legal obligations of states and the soft law responsibilities of companies in mitigating the negative impacts of their business practices on human rights."}]}

Langdon Winner suggested that understanding which issues are seldom legitimized and which groups are excluded from power can reveal the social structures underpinning political power. Analyzing information security through this lens, research by the Citizen Lab has shown that government and non-state actors use the same espionage tactics against civil society as they do against private and government sectors. However, civil society groups often lack the resources to defend against such threats, leaving them vulnerable to persistent digital espionage."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI assistant specialized in cybersecurity and information security research."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Why is civil society vulnerable to digital espionage?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Civil society typically lacks the resources, support, and capacity to deal with threats such as digital espionage. Defending against these threats can require substantial investments in money, time, equipment, and personnel, which many civil society groups cannot afford. Furthermore, civil society is not considered a lucrative client for the multibillion-dollar cybersecurity industry. Thus, even when private firms identify civil society as a target in their monitoring data, there are few fiscal incentives to provide follow-up support. This often results in reports that emphasize industry and government targets over nongovernmental organizations, perpetuating misguided assumptions about the scope of information security problems."}]}

As Yaron Ezrahi suggests, fictions embedded within discourses act as necessary elements that transform imaginaries like the public sphere or civil society into perceived facts, influencing rational behavior. Sheila Jasanoff builds on this by defining imaginaries as institutionalized collective beliefs about societal functions and values, which shape the structural context for discursive agency. Through appealing to ideals and offering simplified interpretations of events and causalities, narratives and imaginaries establish the boundaries of legitimate behavior and rational public discourse. In the context of multistakeholderism, these narratives also possess 'organizational potential,' affecting social identities and motivating communities to overcome challenges and pursue collective missions."}]}

While these initiatives are increasing in popularity as a framework for decision-making, empirical studies, such as those by Pattberg and Widerberg (2016), often report disappointing outcomes. They find that many initiatives fail to develop new global norms, improve the implementation of existing regulations, or include marginalized groups effectively. Moreover, the inclusion of multiple stakeholders is seen as crucial for policy legitimacy, leading to pressure on actors to participate and reducing room for independent critique. These partnerships are not just neutral tools but are areas of contestation over technologies and practices, and they often may not succeed where traditional multilateral processes also struggle."}]}

These are derived from an imaginary that transcends immediate application, promoting inclusivity, transparency, equality, and fairness. This democratizes global regulation, extending democracy beyond borders for legitimate transnational policymaking. Discourse analysis examines these narratives' interaction with regulatory practices to understand how they become sources of shared goals, direct action, and foster legitimacy. Two key examples, the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), illustrate the multistakeholder narrative's performative effect.

It was founded on the multistakeholder principle that involves governments, business entities, civil society, and intergovernmental organizations. However, from its inception, some stakeholders, particularly civil society and the technical sector, have expressed concerns about the UN's stakeholder taxonomy, arguing it misrepresents them. These classifications are significant as they affect the distribution of seats in committees and shape public discourse identities. The struggles with stakeholder taxonomy highlight the complexities within Internet governance, especially as the geographic and political diversity of participants expands. The challenge is to maintain internal coherence while accommodating diverse opinions across formal classifications. The process of bringing together various sectors for dialogue can be intensely political, involving significant effort to keep stakeholder groups aligned and negotiate their boundaries."}]}
