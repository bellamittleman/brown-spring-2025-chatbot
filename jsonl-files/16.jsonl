As humanity ventures further into space, both man-made and natural debris will become a source of disruption that needs anticipation and mitigation through design protocols, architectural resilience, and tracking policies. Additionally, communication in space is challenged by the speed of light, which, albeit fast at 3x10^8 meters per second, results in delays because of the vast distances. For example, light from the sun takes about eight minutes to reach Earth. Signals between Earth and Mars take between five and 20 minutes, depending on their positions in the solar system, causing variable delays and connectivity issues due to planetary rotations."}]}

Combined with potential issues from space debris, planetary magnetic fields, solar flares, and asteroids, these factors create a unique set of challenges for internet architecture in space. Current network engineering principles, reliant on low transmission loss assumptions, do not suffice. This environment demands new design choices, such as adding store-and-forward memory capacity in routers, as opposed to simply forwarding packets. Systems requiring multiple transmissions, like DNS lookups, or those utilizing substantial back-and-forth communication, may not be ideal or feasible in space. Adjustments in systems for authentication, identity protocols, error detection and correction, and address translation are necessary to cope with massive latency and packet loss. Design principles now require greater autonomy in network nodes, local processing on routers, and possibly smaller packet sizes, avoiding round-trip session establishment. Engineering initiatives, such as those overseen by the Internet Engineering Task Force’s (IETF’s) Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) group, are actively addressing these challenges."}]}

A common synchronizing approach on Earth uses the Network Time Protocol. In space, time synchronization faces new challenges due to relativity, which states that time moves differently in varying gravitational fields.

The Outer Space Treaty sets the foundational principles for space exploration, emphasizing that such activities should benefit all humankind and remain free of national sovereignty claims. Although originally focused on activities like exploration and use of space for scientific purposes, these treaties form a backdrop against which new agreements like the Artemis Accords are assessed. These frameworks, while historically inducing collaboration on space exploration, now increasingly pertain to emerging domains such as deep space communication networks due to their foundational principles and ongoing collaborative spirit.

This is partly because these treaties were established before the widespread adoption of internet technologies and the proliferation of satellites. As a result, they do not cover routine human communication over networks, or space-based systems connecting cyber-physical systems such as 3D printing and IoT devices. They also precede the current dependency on satellites for national security and societal functions including GPS navigation, financial transactions, weather forecasting, broadcasting, and internet access.

These entities work together to keep the system running smoothly, with minimal government control. Examples of RIRs are the African Network Information Centre, the Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre, and others spread across the globe.

The allocation of these identifiers; determining who will do it and under what processes; will likely be as economically and politically important—and possibly contentious—as the control of Critical Internet Resources (CIRs) on Earth. Setting standards for an interplanetary internet involves creating technical blueprints for interoperability of digital information exchange.

Delay-tolerant network architectures are being developed, with an emphasis on persistent storage at network nodes and advanced diagnostics for reliability.

Public policy concerns about competition, antitrust, and digital inclusion arise from these agreements.

Unlike terrestrial networks that require securing and authenticating exchanges and agreeing on interoperability standards, deep-space interconnection must contend with intermittent and variable connectivity due to the relative movement of objects. This environment demands a shift to entirely wireless transmission using both radio-frequency and optical communication methods. Additionally, deep-space interconnection needs store-and-forward capabilities and predictive information about when devices are capable of communication. Unlike the Earth-based assumption of constant connectivity, space requires detailed 'contact plan' information for temporary communication opportunities.

National space programs and private-public partnerships might be reluctant to interconnect their networks due to national security and mission safety concerns. Additionally, there is a risk of emulating the proprietary systems of the past, rather than creating a public-purpose, multi-use network for shared discovery and exploration.

IP addresses are crucial for almost all digital transactions, making control over these finite resources politically and economically significant. These addresses serve as global unique identifiers, which can be linked to personal information, thus becoming personal identifiers in some contexts. Political entities, like China, have even proposed alternative systems, signaling ongoing politicization.

This phenomenon is not new; similar issues have arisen in digital technology development, particularly concerning encryption. There is a tension between securing critical infrastructure and weakening encryption for law enforcement and intelligence. In space, decisions on whether networks should be 'air gapped' or interoperable with tight security reflect Earth-bound cyberwar tensions.

Infrastructures of space internet governance could be co-opted as proxies for political power, similar to how the DNS has been used by governments for content control or political censorship. Governments may leverage infrastructure companies and institutions to execute disruptions or surveillance. For instance, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Ukrainian deputy minister requested ICANN and RIPE NCC to disconnect Russia from the internet, although they declined for technical reasons. Given the strategic importance of space networks to national security and societal functioning, they might become targets for political objectives unrelated to their original operations.
