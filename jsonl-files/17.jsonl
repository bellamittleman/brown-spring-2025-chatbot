A weak or non-existent correlation (e.g., a Pearson correlation value of -0.141 with statistical significance) may indicate that simply having a high number of CVEs does not necessarily increase exploitation risk, emphasizing the importance of targeted patching approaches.

Current studies indicate that greater service exploitation opportunities exist in highly populated areas, with states like California, Virginia, and Florida showing particular concerns.

The eight states within this region—Atlanta, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North and South Carolina, and Tennessee—pose the greatest vulnerability to service-based attacks. Larger urban and suburban centers expose more people to cyber insecurity risks, whereas rural communities with lesser demand for digital services have smaller service-based attack surfaces.\n\nAdditionally, an interesting trend emerges when analyzing the relationship between infrastructure and exploitable services. With under 1000 IP addresses per state, service diversity increases with the number of IP addresses. But between 1000 and 2000 IP addresses, the increase in infrastructure does not lead to significantly more attack opportunities. However, beyond 2000 IP addresses, the service-based attack surface diversity expands exponentially, indicating the challenges IT managers face in navigating larger digital footprints, especially in managing complex IT infrastructures."}]}

DNS misconfiguration and insecure authorization are common vulnerabilities, affecting over 50% of counties in most US states. Virginia is notably prone to three of four identified attack scenarios, while Arizona is particularly vulnerable to insecure file sharing attacks.

In contrast, the majority of counties (829) present very low risk levels (up to 1.0 out of 10.0).

CVE-based measurement covers 32% of all counties, with data coverage varying from 20% to 40% across states. The missing data is random and thus does not significantly impact the generalization of results. However, to address this, researchers plan to bypass Shodan's CVE information by querying the NVD database directly based on versioned CPEs. Another limitation is that these assessments mainly measure publicly exposed attack surfaces visible through public internet scans, without incorporating in-depth assessments from direct interviews with counties or detailed network evaluations, which could add more complexity and fidelity to the analysis."}]}

In terms of CVE-based measures, systems could be patched without reflecting changes in CPE versions, or vulnerabilities might have been addressed in older versions through back-porting.
