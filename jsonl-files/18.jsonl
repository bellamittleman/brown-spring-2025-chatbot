Notably, CVE-2025-21298 is a Windows flaw that allows attackers to run arbitrary code via a malicious .rtf file, commonly opened with Office applications like Word. It's rated with a CVSS score of 9.8, indicating a high threat level, and is considered 'exploitation more likely.' Another critical bug, CVE-2025-21311, exists in the NTLMv1 protocol and is remotely exploitable. A vulnerability in Bitlocker, CVE-2025-21210, involves potential plaintext recovery of hibernation images. Mitigating these vulnerabilities is crucial to ensuring system security."}]}
