Unlike previous generations where security was often added after the fact, 5G is incorporating security measures directly into the standards during the development process. This proactive approach is largely facilitated by entities like 3GPP and SA3, which are instrumental in creating standards that include security from the outset. This not only streamlines the security implementation but also improves overall protection against threats. While concerns exist about external influences on the standards process, there are controls and rules in place to prevent such interference. Additionally, security measures are being enhanced on the IT device side to safeguard against potential threats. Overall, 5G is trending in the right direction concerning security advancements."}]}

Unlike the older technologies like SS7 and Diameter, which were heavily reliant on centralized equipment, 5G is truly cloud-based and software-driven. IT technologies are finally integral to the telecom market, signifying a convergence of data and voice. However, this advancement also presents security challenges, especially as we integrate more IoT devices. We've learned from past technologies that not all partners in our ecosystem can be trusted, some being complicit in exposing networks to rogue actors. Consequently, the industry is now focused on securing network boundaries to mitigate these risks."}]}

To address supply chain risks, the National Risk Management Center was established to study these functions and collaborate with industry to mitigate risks. Part of this effort is the ICT Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) Task Force, which aims to align federal government efforts on supply chain issues with industry practices. This involves understanding what the industry can tolerate and the realities of supply and acquisition within telecommunications. The task force focuses on identifying risks and has defined five key workstreams to advance their objectives. Industry buy-in is essential, as any changes in supply chain management can have significant impacts on telecommunications businesses."}]}
