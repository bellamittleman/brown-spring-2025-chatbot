Instead, Trump issued an executive order for an 'AI Action Plan' led by top advisors, revising policies to remove barriers to AI leadership. Trump appointed David Sacks, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, as the AI & crypto czar, who argues that Biden's policies drove AI and crypto innovation overseas. Sacks claims non-fungible tokens and memecoins should be treated as 'collectibles' and not regulated like securities or commodities, which opens a debate on how they're taxed and regulated."}]}

This includes the launch of vanity memecoins by President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump, named $TRUMP and $MELANIA. The market capitalization of these assets has seen fluctuations, with $TRUMP at about $7 billion and $MELANIA around $460 million as per the latest reports. Despite these personal investments, President Trump issued an executive order that calls for the development of a federal regulatory framework for digital assets, chaired by Sacks, as well as an evaluation of establishing a strategic national digital assets stockpile. This move indicates an intention to use federal resources to support the volatile cryptocurrency market, which is often plagued by scams, cyber theft, and money laundering activities."}]}

In political developments, the House Judiciary Committee's Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, led by GOP Rep. Jim Jordan, began investigating alleged collusion between the Biden administration and tech companies regarding political speech. Attention was also directed at the Disinformation Governance Board, an advisory board to DHS, which faced significant controversy and was eventually dissolved. Previous investigations, such as the special prosecutor's inquiry into the 2016 election, underscored ongoing tensions around government and cybersecurity expert interactions."}]}

The real impact of the 2022 law, however, is in the restrictions it places on Trump's ability to replace terminated Inspectors General (IGs) with loyalists, which are likely constitutional. This could complicate Trump's efforts to appoint loyalists to IG positions, but success depends more on whether Congress defends IG independence."}]}
