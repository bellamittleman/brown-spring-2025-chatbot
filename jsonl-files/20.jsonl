The SD can determine path loss in various ways, depending on the sharing approach and type of radar. For example, for an ATC radar that rotates horizontally at a constant speed, an SD may combine prior knowledge of the radar with observations over multiple rotations to establish a pattern of expected link loss. Cooperative sharing could be used where the radar explicitly informs SDs about patterns. However, weather radars scan in both planes, and their speed changes with approaching storms, making cooperative schemes more useful. The SD should stop transmitting and resynchronize if unexpected pattern changes occur. High interference can lead to radars misdetecting targets, necessitating a defined maximum in-band Interference-to-Noise Ratio (INR) to protect radar performance."}]}

Additionally, technical errors can lead to miscalculations affecting secondary transmission operations. A new regulatory approach is needed to manage these risks, ensuring reliable spectrum sharing. The system's Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) determines achievable data rates, assuming secondary transmissions do not interfere with short radar pulse intervals, typically less than 1 ms.

Here are some highlights from the references you might find useful: \n1. B. Bedford and F. Sanders discussed spectrum sharing and its potential interference with radar systems in their 2007 ISART publication.\n2. The UK Office of Communications (Ofcom) in December 2009 addressed the coexistence of S Band radar systems and adjacent future services.\n3. J.M. Peha, in a 2011 ISART paper, explored the spectral efficiency of cellular systems sharing the same spectrum with rotating radar.\n4. R.L. Hinkle et al. provided assessments and model validations for spectrum resources in the 2.7 to 2.9 GHz band, detailed in a 1976 OT Report.\n5. In the book 'LTE for UMTS,' edited by H. Holma and A. Toskala, various authors detailed performance aspects of LTE, focusing on OFDMA and SC-FDMA radio access.\n6. The ITU-R Recommendation P.1546-4 offers a methodology for point-to-area predictions for terrestrial services in the 30 MHz to 3 000 MHz range, published in 2009.\nThese publications provide valuable insights into the technical challenges and methodologies in spectrum management and radar systems."}]}
