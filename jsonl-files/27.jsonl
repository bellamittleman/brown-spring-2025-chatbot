Finally, there's a lack of incentive for efficient use, risking a tragedy of the commons, as seen with Citizen Band radio service inefficiencies.

There are two main approaches: usage-based pricing, where devices pay fees based on the spectrum they consume, and a one-time fee model, where a charge is applied when each device is deployed, regardless of actual usage. Usage-based systems require monitoring by a centralized authority to manage and regulate spectrum usage."}]}

The decision to allocate more spectrum hinges on whether it can be used efficiently.

Spectrum sharing is feasible with the existing framework, incorporating unlicensed bands within the licensed system. The Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) bands serve as a basic example where unlicensed devices are allowed secondary access while sharing the bands with licensed devices that have primary access. Unlicensed devices shouldn't cause harmful interference to licensed devices and must accept any interference from them, as well as from other unlicensed devices. In ISM bands, only devices using spread spectrum modulation are permitted, with a transmission power cap of 1 Watt. This modulation technique's low signal energy density, combined with power limits, helps to minimize interference threats. However, these devices remain susceptible to interference from licensed users and other unlicensed users. The system features an upper power limit to mitigate issues of overuse but doesn't encourage efficient power use. Devices tend to operate at maximum power for optimal signal-to-noise ratio, leading to inefficiency, even when less power would suffice. Nonetheless, the power cap is relatively low, tackling some issues but hindering efficiency since higher power transmission isn't possible, even in scenarios devoid of interference or contention. In other unlicensed bands like the 2GHz PCS band, spectrum sharing is managed through an etiquette-based approach."}]}

If the received power is low enough to suggest minimal risk of interference, they may transmit. This provides superior interference protection compared to systems relying solely on power limits, allowing for greater diversity in device technologies. However, the etiquette cannot differentiate between applications of varying value, restricting them equally, and has provisions to boost spectrum efficiency, such as searching the band from left to right for bandwidths under 625kHz to reduce fragmentation. Additionally, the etiquette mandates operational restrictions to prevent excessive spectrum use, like increasing the threshold for channel availability at low powers to minimize delays, and requiring transmissions to cease in the absence of an acknowledgment within 30 seconds. The necessity and sufficiency of these restrictions for efficient operation are still being evaluated."}]}

For licensed spectrum, the goal of conserving spectrum is crucial as the spectrum is typically used exclusively by the device's users. In contrast, in unlicensed spectrum, while conserving spectrum remains important at the system level, individual device designers have less incentive to prioritize spectrum conservation. This can lead to 'greedy' design approaches, where devices may waste shared spectrum to achieve their own performance goals. A device's resource consumption depends on transmission duration, bandwidth, and coverage area. In unlicensed spectrum, devices may exhibit greedy behavior by increasing transmission duration, bandwidth, or power beyond necessity. This can lead to inefficient use of the shared resource."}]}

Devices may be designed to transmit longer to avoid these delays whenever they need to send a message again. For instance, a wireless bridge in the PCS unlicensed band connecting two LANs might continue to transmit after sending a packet to avoid the delay imposed by the Listen Before Talk (LBT) protocol. This hoarding of spectrum can benefit the device user by reducing access delay for subsequent packets, but it prevents other devices from using the channel and may make it harder to reclaim once released."}]}

However, this practice reduces frequency reuse in the system and leads to other disadvantages. According to current FCC regulations, the Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) noise threshold, which determines if a channel is busy or free, is dependent on transmit power. Increasing transmit power lowers this noise threshold, causing greater access delays. Moreover, battery-powered devices may experience reduced battery life when transmitting at high power. In scenarios where greedy behavior degrades system performance, adjustments to regulations might be needed to discourage such behavior and avoid a tragedy of the commons."}]}

The devices are close enough that they can receive each other's transmissions, preventing frequency reuse. Both devices follow the isochronous band etiquette and require the same bandwidth for their transmissions. Messages arrive at these devices according to a Poisson process, with message lengths distributed exponentially. Messages are queued in an infinitely long buffer until they can be transmitted. Some devices may behave greedily by holding onto the channel longer than necessary, while non-greedy devices release the channel after transmitting their last message. Greedy devices hold the channel for a minimum duration T even if they have no messages.

The delay for Device 1 is minimized when its greed is zero, providing no incentive for Device 1 to be greedy. However, with a lower load of 10%, Device 1 benefits from greed as predicted. In this scenario, Device 1's delay is minimized at 160 ms, while Device 2's delay increases. This incentivizes Device 1 to be greedy, negatively impacting Device 2's performance. Furthermore, in a fluid-flow model (Section 4.2), when one device is greedy, both devices tend towards greed, escalating the situation. This is supported by Figure 5, which shows reaction functions when both devices have a 10% load and 0.5 ms message transmission time.

Factors such as the monitoring time and power threshold can be used as incentives, promoting efficient modulation by assigning larger monitoring times to devices requesting large bandwidths. Another influential factor is the inter-burst gap, which is the minimum wait time a device must observe before re-transmitting after a completed transmission. This gap can be manipulated to encourage shorter transmissions by offering shorter inter-burst gaps as rewards. Furthermore, the back-off period, defined as the minimum wait time before a device retries accessing a busy channel, could be adjusted based on the spectrum resources consumed, incentivizing spectrum conservation. Future work aims to further investigate how these parameters can enhance efficient spectrum utilization."}]}

Figures such as the ones described illustrate that as Device 2's greed increases, Device 1 experiences increased delays when Device 1 operates at its optimal greed, both devices under a 10% load and an average message transmission time of 0.5 ms. Similarly, when both devices have equal greed, the delay for each device tends to increase as greed increases, particularly when the devices are operating with loads of over 10%. Monitoring time in these scenarios is maintained at 10 ms."}]}
