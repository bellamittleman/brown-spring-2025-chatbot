This includes mass layoffs and firings in federal agencies such as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). Over 130 employees, including those working to secure U.S. elections and combat misinformation, have been dismissed. Meanwhile, there's an ongoing effort by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to gain control over agency networks and data, spearheaded by staff like Edward “Big Balls” Coristine, who is notably linked to cybercriminal networks."}]}

He gained notoriety in 2015 for leaking the user database of the DDoS-for-hire service LizardStresser, which led to threats against his family. Known online as 'enKrypt,' he previously owned pirated software and hacking forums. DOGE is a group that has steadily gained sensitive network access to several federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration and the Treasury Department. They have sought access to systems at the IRS, which contain personal tax information about Americans."}]}

The New York Times reported that a 25-year-old DOGE employee, Gavin Kliger, has been granted access only to anonymized taxpayer information. However, DOGE's aggressive pursuit of 'massive fraud' has led to security experts warning that it bypasses essential safeguards, such as incident response protocols and auditing. Bruce Schneier and Davi Ottenheimer have referred to DOGE's actions as a national cyberattack, highlighting the replacement of experienced officials with inexperienced operators, potentially undermining data security."}]}

This incident raised concerns about the system's reliability and security measures. In related developments, controversial changes in personnel within federal agencies led to cybersecurity policy shifts. Michelle King, former acting commissioner of the Social Security Administration, was removed for denying DOGE access to sensitive data, and her successor, Leland Dudek, faced administrative leave for his attempts to facilitate DOGE's agenda at the cost of standard protocol. The National Institute of Standards and Technology is also preparing for significant staff cuts, potentially affecting its cybersecurity standards and software vulnerability tracking efforts."}]}

It shifted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) focus away from prosecuting misconduct in the cryptocurrency sector, redirecting resources and even renaming the relevant unit to emphasize 'cyber and emerging technologies.' This change occurred despite the previous SEC chair, Gary Gensler, prioritizing actions against cryptocurrency fraud and large trading platforms like Coinbase. Additionally, on Feb. 10, Trump ordered executive branch agencies to halt enforcement of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, leading to a suspension of foreign bribery investigations. Trump also disbanded the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative and KleptoCapture Task Force, which had been instrumental in combatting corruption and recovering assets from sanctioned individuals, including Russian oligarchs."}]}

This decision was based on Trump's interpretation of Article II, Clause 1 of the Constitution, suggesting that this power is vested in the president. However, according to jurist.org, Article II does not explicitly state that the president or anyone in the executive branch has this power. The judiciary under Article III has the jurisdiction to interpret laws and determine constitutionality. The order also mandates agencies to adhere to performance standards set by the White House Office of Management and Budget, requiring periodic reporting to the president. In alignment with these directives, employees across federal agencies recently received communications from the Office of Personnel Management asking them to submit brief summaries of their work accomplishments weekly."}]}
