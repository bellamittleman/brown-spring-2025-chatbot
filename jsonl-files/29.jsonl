Specifically, within IoT-based WSNs, it is the measure of data quality exchanged among sensor nodes.

It's important for IoT networks to manage resource distribution and anticipate these behaviors to ensure cooperation."}]}

The network can deploy resource incentives to ensure node cooperation and preemptively address potential misbehavior. There are generally two types of selfish node misbehavior: intentional non-forwarding or packet drop, and unintentional packet drop. Intentional misbehavior involves nodes with adequate resources that deliberately choose not to forward packets, known as wicked-selfish nodes. Unintentional packet drops occur due to software faults or a lack of forwarding capacity or memory resources. Malicious nodes, on the other hand, introduce large data packets to overwhelm the network, depleting its resources. Networks often struggle to manage such malicious behavior and typically resort to detecting and removing the offending node from the network. Malicious behavior can primarily be classified into two categories: forwarding and routing. Forwarding malicious nodes may drop packets, modify them, fabricate data, conduct timing attacks, or change routes silently."}]}

Indirect observation depends on shared experiences from other devices or nodes. These systems often use a combination of both types of observation. For example, a trust management scheme proposed for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks computes trust values using Bayesian inference for direct observations and Dempster-Shafer theory for indirect observations, updating reputation accordingly."}]}

This allows for quick detection of node misbehaviors, such as packet dropping or modification, and helps exclude compromised or selfish nodes, increasing network throughput. However, as the number of nodes in the network increases, the total message packets also increase, causing significant overheads that can slow down performance.
