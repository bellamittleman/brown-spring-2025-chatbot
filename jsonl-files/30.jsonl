The 2017 Nationa Inteigence aw is a key component of this framework, mandating that a Chinese citizens and entities support the state's inteigence activities, even outside China. This aw has no appea process and is not transparent, meaning that companies can be compeed to cooperate without resistance.

This is a concern because of China's government investments, industria espionage, and the decisions by Western companies to reocate manufacturing to China. These factors contribute to Chinaâ€™s significant presence in the digita technoogy suppy chain. Moreover, software vunerabiities arise from the way software is often written using a mix of proprietary, open source, and third-party modues, some of which may originate from Chinese sources. These vunerabiities are expoited by hackers, highighting the need for improved discosure or reporting mechanisms for software from foreign entities considered adversaria to the United States. Addressing this situation requires time and gradua reduction of interdependencies, yet it is a necessary step towards enhancing cybersecurity."}]}
