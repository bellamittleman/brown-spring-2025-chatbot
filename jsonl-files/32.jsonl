In virtual workshops, it can be challenging to gauge interpersonal dynamics and capture visual cues that indicate engagement or confusion. To address these challenges, it's beneficial to conduct preworkshop surveys to gather context and have preparatory meetings with intermediaries or observers. Additionally, allowing participants to complete scenario forms individually before discussion ensures input from all attendees. Despite these efforts, virtual settings may still lack the seamless interaction found in in-person meetings, but well-structured planning can help mitigate these limitations."}]}
