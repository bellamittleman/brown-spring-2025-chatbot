Unlike other cyberattacks that may cease if they encounter strong defenses, APTs continue their efforts until they succeed. They often target critical infrastructures, such as power grids, as seen with the Stuxnet attack in 2010 and Triton attack in 2017. Recent studies emphasize the importance of understanding the behavior, tactics, and techniques of APTs beyond just their indicators of compromise (IOCs), like hash values and IP addresses, as focusing solely on IOCs can obscure the APT's overall strategy and lead to misidentification with other cyber threats."}]}

Understanding the behavior of an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) involves more than just identifying indicators of compromise (IoCs). An APT utilizes a variety of attack tools to remain undetected within a target network for extended periods, sometimes months or even years. These tools are employed in different attack stages to reach the target destination. Initially, the attackers gain access to a system and progressively move laterally within the network. A command and control (C&C) center guides each attack phase until harmful activities are concealed. During an APT attack, various tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) are employed, transitioning from one stage to the next. 'Tactics' refer to the approach for executing the attack from start to finish, while 'techniques' describe the technological strategies to achieve the targets. The 'procedure' details the steps the attacker follows to aim at their objectives. TTPs help profile APT actors, making it a crucial feature for detection techniques and anticipating APT attacks early. Due to APTs' elusive nature, detecting these attacks is particularly challenging. Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is frequently used in the industry to analyze and verify potential threats. It aids in identifying APT groups and their TTPs through gathering public threat-related information, potentially including sources used by APT attackers. Such information is invaluable in detecting APT attacks and supporting investigations into them, while also offering insights into APT groups' methods and behaviors, aiding in defense strategy development."}]}

OSINT helps organizations gain insight into how APT groups operate, the tools and techniques they use, and typical methods of gaining system access. However, relying solely on OSINT isn't enough as the data may lack context, making it difficult to fully grasp the motivations and goals of APT attackers. To enhance detection capabilities, this study incorporates two prevalent models of cyberattacks: MITRE ATT&CK and the cyber kill chain. MITRE ATT&CK is a comprehensive matrix detailing the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries at each attack phase. Meanwhile, the cyber kill chain outlines seven sequential stages of an APT attack. By correlating APT-related behavior from reconnaissance to objective attainment with these models, organizations can gain insights into attack objectives early, enabling timely detection and response to potential APT attacks. The proposed APT detection technique is streamlined as 'multi-stage attack-related behavior,' leveraging both MITRE ATT&CK and the cyber kill chain to enhance early detection and understanding of APT behavior."}]}

These tools are integrated with security solutions for network and endpoint security, allowing them to analyze and correlate network traffic to form a detailed attack scenario. They rely on Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) to detect and correct threat infiltration. Despite APTs using dynamic attack code that makes traditional sandboxing and static code analysis difficult, ATD and Wildfire use advanced behavioral analysis and machine learning algorithms to identify and respond to APTs. However, they lack an email gateway solution, so they might not detect the initial stages of an APT attack like phishing emails. Therefore, additional security measures, such as email security solutions, are recommended to protect against APTs."}]}

In the field of APT detection, there are several techniques employed, but they vary in industry interest and effectiveness. The least commonly used are structural and causal correlation-based techniques. Structural methods, known as white-box techniques, require knowledge of the internal structure of networks, including hardware, software, and vulnerabilities. This approach forecasts APT traces based on integrating asset-related information, network topology, and vulnerability data, but it incurs high overhead and is hard to implement with third-party technologies.\n\nOn the other hand, causal correlation identifies APT traces using knowledge of previous events, focusing on exploited vulnerabilities and privileges obtained. This method does not require node-related information, unlike structural methods.\n\nOur analysis indicates that exploiting vulnerabilities is crucial for a successful APT attack. Thus, APT detection strategies that include vulnerability identification prove more effective, despite the need for enhanced methods to leverage attack data."}]}
