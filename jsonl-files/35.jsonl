Despite the importance of these systems, there is often a gap between the technical realities faced by county governments and the funds allocated at national or state levels to address these issues. To bridge this gap, our methodology relies on OSINT-based attack surface measurements. This involves scanning Internet-facing infrastructures and services of all county governments nationwide, and aggregating the results by state, FEMA region, and national levels. By identifying geographic areas with poor cybersecurity, we can pinpoint regions potentially impacting national cyber resilience.

Open services, often overlooked in regular CVE counts, can lead hackers to misconfigured software or allow them to launch campaigns using stolen credentials. This is a common attack vector for successful attacks. Service-based attack surface measurement shows that densely populated areas, notably CA, VA, and FL, face higher service exploitation risks.
