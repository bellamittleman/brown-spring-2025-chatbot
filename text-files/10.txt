DeepSeek AI App
New mobile apps from the Chinese artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) company DeepSeek  have remained
among the top three “free” downloads for Apple and Google devices since their debut on Jan. 25,
2025. But experts caution that many of DeepSeek’ s design choices — such as using hard-coded
encryption keys, and sending unencrypted user and device data to Chinese companies —
introduce a number of glaring security and privacy risks.

https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/02/experts-ﬂag-security-privacy-risks-in-deepseek-ai-app/ 1/10Public interest in the DeepSeek AI chat apps swelled following widespread media  reports that the
upstart Chinese AI ﬁrm had managed to match the abilities of cutting-edge chatbots while using a
fraction of the specialized computer chips that leading AI companies rely on. As of this writing,
DeepSeek is the third most-downloaded “free” app on the Apple store, and #1 on Google Play .
DeepSeek’ s rapid rise caught the attention of the mobile security ﬁrm NowSecure , a Chicago-
based company that helps clients screen mobile apps for security and privacy threats. In a
teardown  of the DeepSeek app published today , NowSecure urged organizations to remove the
DeepSeek iOS mobile app from their environments, citing security concerns.
NowSecure founder Andrew Hoog  said they haven’t yet concluded an in-depth analysis of the
DeepSeek app for Android  devices, but that there is little reason to believe its basic design would
be functionally much dif ferent.
Hoog told KrebsOnSecurity there were a number of qualities about the DeepSeek iOS app that
suggest the presence of deep-seated security and privacy risks. For starters, he said, the app
collects an awful lot of data about the user ’s device.
“They are doing some very interesting things that are on the edge of advanced device
ﬁngerprinting,” Hoog said, noting that one property of the app tracks the device’ s name — which
for many iOS devices defaults to the customer ’s name followed by the type of iOS device.
The device information shared, combined with the user ’s Internet address and data gathered from
mobile advertising companies , could be used to deanonymize users of the DeepSeek iOS app,
NowSecure warned. The report notes that DeepSeek communicates with Volcengine , a cloud
platform developed by ByteDance  (the makers of TikTok), although NowSecure said it wasn’t
clear if the data is just leveraging ByteDance’ s digital transformation cloud service or if the
declared information share extends further between the two companies.

https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/02/experts-ﬂag-security-privacy-risks-in-deepseek-ai-app/ 2/10Perhaps more concerning, NowSecure said the iOS app transmits device information “in the
clear ,” without any encryption to encapsulate the data. This means the data being handled by the
app could be intercepted, read, and even modiﬁed by anyone who has access to any of the
networks that carry the app’ s trafﬁc.
“The DeepSeek iOS app globally disables App Transport Security (A TS) which is an iOS platform
level protection that prevents sensitive data from being sent over unencrypted channels,” the
report observed. “Since this protection is disabled, the app can (and does) send unencrypted data
over the internet.”
Hoog said the app does selectively encrypt portions of the responses coming from DeepSeek
servers. But they also found it uses an insecure and now deprecated encryption algorithm called
3DES (aka Triple DES ), and that the developers had hard-coded the encryption key . That means
the cryptographic key needed to decipher those data ﬁelds can be extracted from the app itself.
There were other , less alarming security and privacy issues highlighted in the report, but Hoog
said he’ s conﬁdent there are additional, unseen security concerns lurking within the app’ s code.
“When we see people exhibit really simplistic coding errors, as you dig deeper there are usually a
lot more issues,” Hoog said. “There is virtually no priority around security or privacy . Whether
cultural, or mandated by China, or a witting choice, taken together they point to signiﬁcant lapse in
security and privacy controls, and that puts companies at risk.”
Apparently , plenty of others share this view . Axios  reported  on January 30 that U.S. congressional
ofﬁces are being warned not to use the app.
“[T]hreat actors are already exploiting DeepSeek to deliver malicious software and infect devices,”
read the notice from the chief administrative ofﬁcer for the House of Representatives. “T o mitigate
these risks, the House has taken security measures to restrict DeepSeek’ s functionality on all
House-issued devices.”
TechCrunch  reports  that Italy and Taiwan have already moved to ban DeepSeek over security
concerns. Bloomberg  writes  that The Pentagon  has blocked access to DeepSeek. CNBC  says
NASA  also banned employees from using the service, as did the U.S. Navy .
Beyond security concerns tied to the DeepSeek iOS app, there are indications the Chinese AI
company may be playing fast and loose with the data that it collects from and about users. On
January 29, researchers at Wiz said they discovered a publicly accessible database linked to
DeepSeek that exposed “a signiﬁcant volume of chat history , backend data and sensitive
information, including log streams, API secrets, and operational details.”
“More critically , the exposure allowed for full database control and potential privilege escalation
within the DeepSeek environment, without any authentication or defense mechanism to the
outside world,” Wiz wrote. [Full disclosure: Wiz is currently an advertiser on this website.]3/5/25, 10:29 AM Experts Flag Security, Privacy Risks in DeepSeek AI App – Krebs on Security

I have already forwarded this to everyone in our company who has a company cell phone.
Already we only allow a small list of applications on our company phone via Intune. I am also
concerned about the security of our employee’ s personal phones.
I have my one own phone and believe you me, EVER Y one’ s cut of f from deep-seek.Steve Everett

Australian federal government, as well as several state governments, have all banned
DeepSeek (for government usage) for these reasons – and one, suspects questions about
Chinese government access and involvement.Romana Challans

Deepseek has a tendancy to come up with some novel approaches and doesn’t always follow
the norms which have been set by his peer group. He is a loner in some respects, but I sense
his presense, approach and following will grow over the course of 2025. His last piece of work
was completed with haste, no doubt due to family commitments (MIC2025), but I liked the
openness of the code which will allow his peer group to study and learn from it for future
submissions. I’ve given his peers a copy , so they can study it in earnest and I’m hoping they will
learn from it and it will inspire them to further their knowledge and understanding for all to shareMetaW alker
