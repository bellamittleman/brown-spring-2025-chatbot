The internet’s next chapter will likely lie in both 
infinitesimally small and astronomically large 
spaces, including a leap further off Earth and 
into deep space. Already, engineers are working 
on a solar-system internet and developing new 
protocols to withstand the harsh conditions 
and colossal distances of space. As the internet 
moves off planet, so too will internet governance 
and its attendant economic, political and social 
implications. The security implications are 
immense. What are the internet governance 
arrangements — meaning the technical design, 
institutional coordination, norms of behaviour and 
legal instruments — that should be anticipated now 
to help operationalize an interplanetary internet 
for the good of humankind? This paper lays out 
deep-space challenges to internet architecture and 
governance, examines the relevance of existing 
UN space governance treaties to digital networks, 
discusses which layers of terrestrial internet 
governance could be applicable in space, and 
suggests some geopolitical lessons from the history 
of the terrestrial internet that might inform a solar-
system internet and its emerging “heliopolitics.” 
Introduction
The internet might not exist in its contemporary 
form without space exploration. Against the 
backdrop of the Cold War, the Soviet Union 
successfully launched the first artificial Earth 
satellite, Sputnik, in 1957. The American public 
and policy makers alike viewed this as a potential 
crisis for both national security and technological 
leadership. New institutions and rapid 
technological innovation followed. Within a year 
of the Sputnik launch, the United States passed the 
National Aeronautics and Space Act establishing 
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
(NASA), and also founded the Advanced Research 
Projects Agency (ARPA) credited with the early 
innovations that directly led to the global internet. Indeed, developments in space have shaped 
the development of the internet on Earth.1
Is it too soon to discuss an interplanetary internet, 
never mind its governance? History suggests no. 
The modern internet barely existed a half century 
ago. The Advanced Research Projects Agency 
Network (ARPANET) dates back only to the late 
1960s, around the same time NASA successfully 
carried out the Apollo 11 lunar landing and Gordon 
Moore founded microprocessor company Intel 
in an area of California later called Silicon Valley. 
The founders of Google and Facebook were 
not yet born. Even the rise of the World Wide 
Web only dates back to the early 1990s, when 
there was no Amazon, smartphones, Internet 
of Things (IoT) or streaming video. The pace of 
technological transformation has been stunning 
as the internet has diffused into every corner of 
the Earth, around our planet’s atmosphere, into 
material objects and even into the human body. 
The internet’s next frontier likely lies in both 
infinitesimally small and astronomically large 
spaces, with both areas involving cyber-physical 
interfaces and embedded artificial intelligence. 
Digital technologies have already diffused into 
miniscule spaces such as nano-devices and 
wirelessly connected objects inside the human 
body, but will also become more expansive 
as the internet extends into outer space. 
Already, engineers are working on a solar-
system internet and developing new protocols 
to withstand the harsh conditions and colossal 
distances of space. NASA is developing the 
LunaNet network around the Earth’s Moon, and 
the European Space Agency (ESA) is working on a 
similar lunar telecommunications project called 
Moonlight. Humans are embarking on a new age 
of discovery and exploration in space. The Mars 
Perseverance rover and other scientific equipment 
are searching for a history of microbial life and 
collecting data previously unimaginable. The 
James Webb Space Telescope is peering at objects 
as they were 13.6 billion years ago when light left 
early stars and galaxies. Anyone visiting Florida’s 
Space Coast can see regular SpaceX launches 
1 ARPA became the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), 
which describes its origin as follows: “The genesis of that mission and of 
DARPA itself dates to the launch of Sputnik in 1957, and a commitment 
by the United States that, from that time forward, it would be the 
initiator and not the victim of strategic technological surprises.” See 
www.  darpa.  mil/about-us/about-darpa. 2 CIGI Papers No. 277 — June 2023 • Laura DeNardis with reusable rockets landing back on Earth on 
autonomous drone ships. Human settlement of 
space that was once the purview of science fiction 
is now imaginable because of rapid advancements 
in everything from robotics, sustainable energy, 
rocket propulsion and 3D printing, to low-
gravity medical and food advancements.
The future of space exploration depends upon 
the future of a resilient, secure and interoperable 
deep-space communication system. Extending 
conventional nomenclature from Earth, this 
network could be called the “interplanetary 
internet,” a solar-system internet or space network. 
Internet pioneer Vinton Cerf broached the subject of 
an “interplanetary internet” at an Internet Society 
meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, in July 1998 (Kaiser 
1998, 879). Online references to the term do not 
exist prior to this, except in one lone encyclopedia 
entry on Cerf describing his distinguished visiting 
scientist appointment “working on the design of 
an interplanetary Internet” at the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory (JPL).2 Indeed, the inception of work on 
an interplanetary internet began at NASA’s JPL in 
1998 (King 2007). This vision was remarkable in a 
time before most modern internet applications. 
In March 1999, not long after the founding of 
Google, NASA administrator Daniel S. Goldin gave 
a “Pathway to the Future” presentation at NASA’s 
Langley Research Center, presenting a vision for the 
future of NASA. This dot-com era vision prominently 
featured a “space station” and a “Mars plane” as 
well as “interplanetary Internets” (Goldin 1999). 
Reminiscent of the early ARPANET days when only 
a few universities were connected and no one could 
have anticipated what the internet would mean 
to the world, it may not yet be possible to imagine 
the innovative uses of such a network. What can 
be anticipated, though, are uses of networks in 
space to support discovery and exploration; to 
interconnect space stations; to communicate with 
environmental sensors, 3D printers and other cyber-
physical and autonomous objects; and to support 
human space travel and a range of conceivable 
commercial uses as well as the inevitable national 
security and intelligence applications. Many 
initiatives in space already use communication 
networks, such as JPL’s Deep Space Network. 
Most of these are point-to-point communication 
networks between the Earth and spacecraft. The 
2 See https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Vinton+gray+cerf.idea of a solar-system internet is more of a store-
and-forward, distributed, packet switched design 
that interconnects many nodes and multiple 
networks. Designing and building an interoperable 
and secure infrastructure is a necessary precursor 
for anything to happen in space as well as for 
human security on Earth. National security on Earth 
is increasingly dependent upon networks in space. 
Internet governance is not fixed any more than 
technology is fixed. “Internet governance” is a 
broad term meant to capture an entire ecosystem 
of actors carrying out the coordination and 
administration of the technologies that keep the 
internet operational and the enactment of policy 
around these technologies. In a literal sense, 
internet governance is an oxymoron because it is 
not just about traditional governments and legal 
instruments but also about decisions made by 
private industry, international organizations and 
technical coordinating organizations, and by the 
very design of technical architecture. Some of 
these tasks include standards setting, oversight 
of unique names and numbers, interconnection 
agreements, cybersecurity governance, and 
the public policy role of private infrastructure 
and media companies whose decisions shape 
conditions of privacy, surveillance, speech and 
digital security. Some functions involve one actor. 
Many involve coordination across different kinds of 
actors. Together, this collection of tasks is usually 
called “multistakeholder internet governance.” 
What was once the esoteric domain of technical 
specialists, some academics and specialized 
governmental agencies has landed at the top of 
global policy agendas. Politicians at the highest 
level speak about cyber governance in the same 
breath as other pressing global problems such as 
war, terrorism, human rights and the environment. 
How governance decisions around digital 
infrastructure unfold has deep consequences for 
the economy, critical infrastructure protection, 
the political sphere, consumer safety, speech, 
innovation policy and national security. The internet 
is in everything. Internet governance is therefore 
entangled with most public policy problems. 
As the internet moves off planet, so will internet 
governance and all its economic, political and 
social implications. The security implications 
alone are immense. What are the internet 
governance arrangements — meaning the 
technical design, institutional coordination and 
legal instruments — that should be anticipated 3 Interplanetary Internet Governancenow to help operationalize an interplanetary 
internet for the good of humankind? Is this just 
an extension of terrestrial internet governance, 
or do the unique political and material contexts 
of space require something new? Are existing 
space treaties relevant? What types of public 
interest requirements have to be designed now 
into the architecture? What cooperation among 
nation-states is necessary to invest in and benefit 
from this network? Under what agreements 
and assurances should networks connect? 
Because there is not yet an interplanetary internet, 
examining the coordination points and political 
tensions around this emerging infrastructure is 
an exercise in anticipatory governance. Scholars 
of science and technology studies conceptually 
embrace “anticipatory governance” with an 
objective of constructing emerging technologies 
that consider human flourishing and human 
security.3 Anticipatory governance can be defined as 
“a broad-based capacity extended through society 
that can act on a variety of inputs to manage 
emerging knowledge-based technologies while such 
management is still possible” (Guston 2014, 219). 
Technical design itself is an act of anticipatory 
governance because political objectives and 
social values as well as practical problem solving, 
shape and embed within technical architecture.4 
Internet governance has often evolved organically 
and reactively, such as building in security and 
authentication systems somewhat after the fact. 
There is a moment of opportunity to anticipate the 
technical coordination functions and heliopolitical 
structures necessary in space to architect a shared 
interplanetary communication future that benefits 
all humankind. As such, this paper proceeds in 
four parts. The first section, “Deep-Space Features 
Shaping Internet Architecture and Governance,” 
examines the unique constraints of space that 
will shape interplanetary network architecture 
and governance. The next section, “Relevance 
of Existing International Space Treaties to the 
Internet,” assesses the applicability of these 
treaties and governance frameworks to deep-space 
information and communication technologies 
(ICTs). The following section, “A Framework of 
Multistakeholder Internet Governance in Space,” 
examines the core layers of internet governance

(1996).on Earth most likely to extend into deep space, 
which ones do not apply and what might be 
missing. The final section, “Internet Governance 
Flashpoints Applicable in Space,” concludes the 
paper by suggesting some geopolitical lessons 
from terrestrial internet governance that might 
inform structures of interplanetary internet 
governance and its emerging heliopolitics.  
Deep-Space Features 
Shaping Internet 
Architecture and 
Governance
Unique constraints and contexts in space will 
shape design and governance in this domain. 
Some are natural, involving harsh atmospheric 
conditions, astronomical distances and planetary 
rotation. Others are human originating, such 
as the dangerous conditions caused by space 
debris. Still other features are political, such 
as the way sovereignty is upended in space. 
The terrestrial system of internet architecture 
and governance cannot just be extended into 
space, but must be reconceptualized and 
re-  engineered to meet these novel conditions. 
Space Debris 
On November 15, 2021, the Russian Federation 
destroyed a Soviet-era satellite that had been 
launched in 1982 (NASA 2022, 1). While the first 
concern of a direct-ascent anti-satellite (ASAT) 
missile test may be a national security one around 
the weaponization of space, a more immediate 
threat materialized. According to NASA’s Orbital 
Debris Quarterly News account of this intentional 
destruction, the US Space Force used the Space 
Surveillance Network to identify “more than 
1500 pieces of large, trackable fragments” 
from the breakup (ibid.). Two months later, the 
China National Space Administration (CNSA) 
announced that a Chinese satellite experienced 
a “near miss” with one of the fragments from 
the Russian ASAT test debris field (Jones 2022). 
The Chinese government itself had previously 
conducted an ASAT test resulting in a massive 4 CIGI Papers No. 277 — June 2023 • Laura DeNardis space-debris field. On January 11, 2007, a Chinese 
ASAT system test hit an “old Chinese meteorological 
spacecraft, Fengyun-1C,” resulting in roughly 
2,000 dangerous fragments greater than 5 cm in 
size and approximately 35,000 fragments greater 
than 1 cm in size (NASA 2007, 2). The United States 
and India have also, at various times, conducted 
direct-ascent ASAT missile tests (NASA 2019, 1). 
It is not so much the size, but the speed, that 
poses the danger. Space debris — which hurtles 
along at rates so fast they are measured in miles 
per second rather than miles per hour — are 
already a risk for the International Space Station 
(ISS), rockets and satellites orbiting the Earth. 
As exploration and communication moves off Earth, 
human-originating space debris — sometimes 
called “space junk” — will likely join natural debris 
(such as micrometeorites) as a space-specific 
source of disruption that must be anticipated 
and addressed in protocol design; architectural 
resiliency and fault-tolerant approaches; 
redundancy, error detection and correction; and 
policy and industry attention to tracking. 
Delay and Disruption
“The speed of light is too slow,” Cerf famously 
said about the delay problem caused by the 
astronomical distances between objects in space 
(D’Agostino 2020). The speed of light is 3x108 
metres per second (or 186,000 miles per second), 
the reason why light from the sun, roughly 93 
million miles from the Earth, takes eight minutes 
to reach Earth. Humans never see the sun in 
real time, but rather the way it appeared eight 
minutes ago. NASA signals between Deep Space 
Network antennas on Earth and the orbiters around 
Mars that relay signals from the Perseverance 
rover take between five and 20 minutes (double 
that for a round-trip signal). The wide variation 
primarily relates to the solar-system position of 
Earth and Mars at the moment of transmission. 
The issue is not just delay but also variable 
delay due to the constantly shifting relative 
distances and locations of solar-system objects. 
Because of this constant movement of celestial 
objects, and also planetary rotation, these objects 
can rotate out of connectivity. The movement of 
planets and their satellites will create constantly 
changing transmission distances and intermittent 
disruptions. Add this to the potential disruptions 
from space debris encounters and, especially, the natural disturbances caused by planetary 
magnetic fields, solar flares and asteroids. 
These delay and disruption conditions will upend 
much of how systems of internet architecture and 
governance work in space. Many existing network 
engineering principles are not applicable. The 
assumption that transmission loss is relatively 
small collapses. Retransmission as the usual 
response to error correction or packet loss is not an 
ideal approach. These conditions will require new 
design choices that add store-and-forward memory 
capacity, such as in routers. On Earth, routers do 
not store packets but rather just forward them. 
From a technical perspective, systems of internet 
governance that require multiple transmissions, 
such as those involving Domain Name System 
(DNS) lookups, or cybersecurity approaches 
involving considerable back and forth, will not 
be ideal in space or even feasible in many cases. 
Coordinating systems around authentication, 
identity, error detection and correction, address 
translation and compression will have to adjust 
to massive latency and routinized packet loss. 
Design principles will require greater autonomy 
in network nodes, local processing capability on 
routers, store-and-forward approaches rather 
than dropping packets, possibly smaller packet 
sizes, and the elimination of network approaches 
requiring round-trip session establishment. 
Indeed, engineering work is already under way. 
The very charter for the Internet Engineering 
Task Force’s (IETF’s) Delay/Disruption Tolerant 
Networking Working Group, for example, aspires 
to “data communications in the presence of 
long delays and/or intermittent connectivity.”5
The critical implication for internet governance 
is that the infrastructures of connectivity and 
coordination now prevalent, from routing 
and addressing to the DNS, will require 
fundamental redesigns or replacements.
Node Intelligence and Autonomy
One of the early design principles of the internet 
was to locate intelligence at end points. This 
principle is upended in space. More autonomy, 
memory and self-resiliency will be expected of 
information and communication nodes in space 
because of routine broken connectivity and 
limitations due to long physical distances. Nodes 
5 See https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/dtn/about/.5 Interplanetary Internet Governancein deep space will need to function even when 
networks are disrupted, and require self-sufficient 
and renewable power, intrinsic memory and 
microprocessing power flexibly capable of carrying 
out multiple tasks. Swapping out a damaged or 
obsolete component will be nearly impossible 
in real time, so maintenance and upgrades will 
have to be largely local or controlled remotely.
A solar-system internet will be, in some ways, 
similar to IoT cyber-physical networks on Earth. 
To have useful applications for discovery and 
exploration, networks will embed directly or 
otherwise interact with the physical world of 
space. Some devices will embed sensors that 
gauge temperature, pressure, movement, chemical 
readings and other physical characteristics. Some 
will have actuators that “act” on the world through 
some output such as rotary motion, linear motion, 
heating, cooling, pressure, and so forth. Deep-
space networks will be as much like cyber-physical 
systems (for discovery and exploration) as the 
screen-based internet of human communication 
(for human transmission from space stations, 
space craft and beyond). In addition to embedding 
additional intelligence and memory to address 
delay and disruption, operational nodes may 
also embed sensors and actuators. But unlike IoT 
devices, which are often engineered for ad hoc 
specific purposes and design parsimony, deep-space 
nodes will be broad-purpose and versatile devices.  
All of the constrained architectural requirements 
facing interplanetary internet nodes — the 
need for renewable power, local processing 
power and memory, heterogenous functionality 
and maintenance self-sufficiency — all come 
down to one design principle: autonomy.  
Time Synchronization in 
Variable Gravitational Fields 
Timekeeping is an underappreciated and taken-
for-granted aspect of internet governance, 
and computer networking in general. So much 
depends upon time synchronization. Atomic 
clocks ultimately serve as the source of time 
standardization on Earth and — by keeping time 
based on the resonant frequencies of atoms — are 
far more precise than rotational time keeping 
such as of the Earth on its axis (days), the Moon 
around the Earth (months) or the Earth around 
the sun (years). Coordinated Universal Time is 
the Earth’s atomic-clock-based standard. Among 
other synchronizing approaches, the Network Time Protocol has long been the standard 
for helping computing devices keep in time 
synchronization to universal atomic time.
The new challenge in space is that, according to 
theories of relativity, time is slower or faster in 
different gravitational fields. For example, because 
of the Moon’s lower mass than the Earth, its 
gravitational field is weaker. Therefore, a clock 
on the Moon would run faster than a clock on 
the Earth. The time synchronization required 
for network transmission and coordination is 
challenged by time relativity and especially how 
different gravitational conditions affect clock speed.  
Sovereignty and 
Extraterritoriality 
Scholars have mulled over complications of 
nation-state jurisdiction relative to the internet 
on Earth since the 1990s.6 Laws and policies 
apply to technologies and institutions within 
national borders, but even this is upended 
because so much of the technical architecture 
crosses borders in ways that have no natural 
correspondence to nation-states.7 The internet’s 
logical (software-defined) architecture is already 
border-agnostic. A single exchange can involve 
a domain name registration in one region, 
cross-border content distribution networks, and 
transmissions originating and terminating in 
one country but switched through an internet 
exchange point (IXP) in another country. This 
porousness has led countries to assert cyber 
sovereignty claims and techniques that turn to 
institutions and infrastructures for political control 
(Musiani et al. 2016). Overlaying a Westphalian 
international relations model on terrestrial 
cyberspace does not comport with either cross-
border technologies or the resulting levers of 
infrastructure control by extraterritoriality.8 At 
the same time, what happens locally can have 
cascading effects, such as local blocking of a 
website accidentally disseminated to the global 
internet via Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).9  
6 See, for example, Wu (1997). See also Johnson and Post (1996).
7 For a broad literature review of cyber sovereignty scholarship, see 
Mueller (2020).
8 For a detailed theoretical examination of digital sovereignty via 
infrastructure “situated practices,” see Musiani (2022).
9 For one example, see Singel (2008).6 CIGI Papers No. 277 — June 2023 • Laura DeNardis In space, there is no sovereignty over celestial 
bodies and free space, at least not at this time 
and under current international treaties. But 
this does not preclude conflicts over cyber 
sovereignty and territorial disputes in space. It 
is also possible that the upending of sovereignty 
could have benefits for a communication system. 
Regardless, in space, international relations 
theory and international law could be further 
upended or possibly more relevant than ever.10 
While there are analogies to cyber sovereignty 
tensions on Earth and also the Law of the Sea 
on Earth, the expansive reach and challenges 
of outer space make this domain sui generis. 
The pragmatic, theoretical and legal limits to 
nation-state control or ownership of outer space 
are, in themselves, inherent political features, but 
will be further complicated by extensions into 
space of extraterritorial control exerted in the 
terrestrial internet via co-opting infrastructure, 
the privatization of governance and the ways in 
which local actions cascade outward. Jurisdiction 
is already disrupted by features of the terrestrial 
internet. The contemporary nature of sovereignty in 
space will further complicate internet governance 
and require greater cooperation and negotiation 
among multiple stakeholders, as well as new 
heliocentric political frameworks. Reciprocally, 
the technologies extended into space will 
affect the international order on Earth because 
so much of national security and economic 
resiliency depends upon space systems.
Relevance of Existing 
Space Treaties to the 
Internet
Space is already governed by a constellation of 
treaties and alliances, many of which arose during 
the mid-twentieth-century space race between the 
United States and the Soviet Union.11 In the Cold 
War context, very few nations had any programs 
10 For an analysis of international relations theory and the space domain, 
see Pace (2023).
11 For a more detailed history and description of the treaties and laws 
applicable to space, see Aganaba (2021). for space exploration. The Soviet Union launched 
Sputnik in 1957. The United Nations launched 
the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs 
(UNOOSA) the following year, in 1958. UNOOSA’s 
Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space 
became the forum for international treaties and 
principles on space-related activities12 (UNOOSA 
2022). Out of this institutional context came five 
foundational UN space treaties (UNOOSA 2017) 
(see Table 1). The first one, the Outer Space Treaty 
(OST), arose contemporaneously with and in 
the same geopolitical and technological context 
as ARPANET. The last of the five main treaties 
was adopted the same year Apple released the 
original Macintosh computer and prior to the 
development of the World Wide Web. Since that 
time, there have also been bilateral and other 
multilateral agreements, such as the Artemis 
Accords. To what extent are they applicable 
to communication networks in deep space?
The cornerstone of space governance is the 
OST. In 1967, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) 
adopted this foundational Treaty on Principles 
Governing the Activities of States in the 
Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including 
the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies to establish 
that space exploration and use should be “for 
the benefit of all” humankind and open to 
all states, as well as not subject to sovereign 
appropriation.13 States also agree to not place 
nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass 
destruction in space and to use the Moon and 
planets only for peaceful purposes. Originally 
signed by the United States, the United Kingdom 
and the Soviet Union, more than 100 countries 
have since become parties to the treaty.
The Rescue Agreement quickly followed in 1968, 
elaborating on the core principles of the OST. 
The UN treaty, officially called the Agreement 
on the Rescue of Astronauts, the Return of

of space objects.14 The text from the original Rescue 
Agreement from the 1960s helps convey the tone 
and style of the agreement — around international 
cooperation, peaceful exploration, freedom and 
mutual aid — very much through the lens of 
nation-state authority and UN coordination.15 
In 1972, the Convention on International Liability 
for Damage Caused by Space Objects (the Space 
Liability Convention) opened for signature and 
took force to hold nation-states responsible for any 
damage caused by a “space object.”16 In 1976, the 
Convention on Registration of Objects Launched 
into Outer Space went into force to track the 
increasing number of so-called space objects placed 
into orbit or launched for various purposes.17 The 
Registration Convention is essentially a tracking 
agreement requiring registration of objects 
launched into outer space. The meaning of the 
word “tracking” is quite different than in the cyber 
realm and does not mean real-time tracking but 
just a registration of orbital and functional details. 
While written in the context of launching states, 
the registration of objects launched from a nation-
state — submitted to UNOOSA for inclusion in the 
space registry — includes private enterprises. For 
example, the US submissions to the registry often 
include dozens or hundreds of private satellite

The Moon Agreement is different in kind in that 
the treaty has not been signed by any of the major 
human spaceflight countries, including China, 
Japan, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom 
or the United States. One of the concerns, among 
others, involved the treaty’s call for establishing 
an “international regime” for governing natural 
resources from the Moon, and the imprecision 
about what that might mean. Yet it entered 
into force for its ratifying parties in 1984 as the 
Agreement Governing the Activities of States on 
the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies to lay out 
numerous provisions about the Moon, such as 
prohibiting rights of ownership, calling for lunar 
resources not being subject to appropriation or 
international conflict, and essentially calling for 
a framework of laws establishing international 
cooperation and a commitment to environmental 
protection and equality, among other provisions.19

applications and uses of space technology such as weather or communications.9 Interplanetary Internet Governancemilitary bases on the lunar surface and placing 
into lunar orbit weapons of mass destruction. 
Collectively, these existing space governance 
treaties do not directly address ICTs and are not 
easily applicable to the cyber domain. This is, in 
part, because the treaties predate most internet 
technologies. They neither address routine human 
communication over networks, nor the emerging 
vision of space networks connecting cyber-
physical systems such as additive manufacturing 
(for example, 3D printing) and IoT devices.
The treaties also predate mass satellite proliferation 
and the complete and total national and societal 
strategic dependency on satellites on Earth. 
Losing satellite communication on Earth would 
be catastrophic. Some of the societal functions 
that depend upon space communications include 
transportation systems and GPS navigation, 
financial transactions including time-stamping 
of financial transactions, weather forecasting, 
television and entertainment broadcasting, first 
responder communications and internet access, 
among many other critical operations on Earth. 
They also predate terrestrial national security 
dependency on space systems, including real-time 
monitoring, drone navigation, and command-and-
control networks. Space is an operational domain 
for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. There is 
now a rebranded French Air and Space Force and a 
US Space Force armed service, established in 2019 
by the National Defense Authorization Act with 
the motto “semper supra” (“always above”) and a 
mission to both “protect U.S. and allied interests 
in space and to provide space capabilities to the 
joint force.”20 Space is considered a domain of 
warfare that is just as strategic as other domains. 
The overall space governance framework 
is quite different from internet governance 
frameworks, one largely multilateral and one 
largely multistakeholder. Internet governance 
is not based on treaties and international law 
and has historically been multistakeholder, a 
very contested term and model of governance 
but one that realistically captures the role of 
private actors in the design, administration and 
20 See www.spaceforce.mil/About-Us/FAQs/Whats-the-Space-Force/.governance of cyberspace.21 Applying international 
relations regime theory to multistakeholder 
internet governance, Joseph S. Nye Jr. describes 
the constellation of institutions, rules, laws, 
policies and norms as a “cyber regime complex,” 
far more distributed and fragmented of an 
approach than the historical multilateral treaties 
of space (Nye 2014). In the context of the OST 
in the mid-1960s, two superpowers dominated 
space. The number of space-faring nations 
has grown significantly over the decades. 
While space governance has continued to centre 
on the nation-state, a feature that both space 
and internet technical architecture contexts now 
share is rising privatization. In the same way the 
internet shifted from the government-funded 
ARPANET to a commercial global network, space 
exploration — however nascent — has expanded 
to private, often billionaire-financed companies 
such as Blue Origin, SpaceX and Virgin Galactic. 
The Soviet Union and US “space race” during the 
Cold War was driven largely by these nation-states, 
although carried out via private contractors. The 
internet has had a shift from public funding to 
private enterprise, and the trajectory of space travel 
and exploration has begun to shift from the 1960s 
Manhattan Project-style quest to land a person 
on the Moon to an era of private exploration. 
Major space exploration countries acknowledge 
and celebrate this privatization of space innovation. 
For example, the National Space Policy of the 
United States lists as its first goal to “promote and 
incentivize private industry to facilitate the creation 
of new global and domestic markets for United 
States space goods and services, and strengthen 
and preserve the position of the United States as 
the global partner of choice for international space 
commerce” (The White House 2020, 5). The major 
space treaties predate this degree of privatization, 
although the treaties certainly convey state 
responsibility for all national space activities. 
As a Wilson Center article on space governance 
suggested, “The current global space governance 
framework has been slow to take evolving state 
and industry practices as well as technological 
21 There are many models and many contexts of multistakeholder 
governance. Drawing from John Ruggie’s pioneering study of 
multilateralism, Mark Raymond and Laura DeNardis (2015) offer a 
taxonomy of different types of multistakeholder institutional forms that 
vary based on what combination of actor class is participating, as well as 
the nature of the authority relations among these actors. 10 CIGI Papers No. 277 — June 2023 • Laura DeNardis 
changes into consideration, namely around 
issues of celestial resource use and space 
militarization. The growing number of non-
traditional players warrants a need for additional, 
if not revised, legal measures to ensure stronger 
global space governance and the safety and 
sustainability of space for the future ahead” 
(Goguichvili, Linenberger and Gillette 2021). 
Beyond the major UN space treaties, there are 
also more recent, still nation-state-centred, efforts 
toward bilateral or multilateral agreements and 
norm development relative to the space domain. 
The Artemis Accords is one such multilateral 
agreement. The Artemis Accords is a non-binding, 
multilateral22 set of principles for the Artemis 
human space and exploration program led by 
NASA and partners — the Canadian Space Agency 
(CSA), ESA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration 
Agency (JAXA) — to send astronauts back to the 
Moon. The Artemis Accords, while an extrapolation 
of many OST principles, notably includes a 
section on interoperability: “The Signatories 
recognize that the development of interoperable 
and common exploration infrastructure and 
standards, including but not limited to fuel 
storage and delivery systems, landing structures, 
communications systems, and power systems, 
will enhance space-based exploration, scientific 
discovery, and commercial utilization. The 
Signatories commit to use reasonable efforts 
to utilize current interoperability standards for 
space-based infrastructure, to establish such 
standards when current standards do not exist or 
are inadequate, and to follow such standards.”23
The ISS helped demonstrate the utility and need 
for interoperability among space components 
built by different constituencies. The Artemis 
Accords speaks to interoperability among 
lunar bases as they develop, and includes 
communication standards as a key component 
of this interoperability. However, note that 
China is not a signatory. Beyond the practical 
considerations and shared benefits of making 
systems interoperate on and around the lunar 
surface, the existence of technical standards would 
22 As of April 2023, the signatories of the Artemis Accords include 
Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, France, the Isle of Man, 
Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, New Zealand, Nigeria, Poland, 
South Korea, Romania, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Ukraine, the 
United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States.

space-faring nations and companies and increase 
the sustainability of networks, once developed. 
More specific existing space governance tasks 
related to communication systems also emanate 
from governmental agreements and coordination. 
For example, electromagnetic spectrum 
allocation and non-interference is an important 
area of international coordination in space. The 
International Telecommunication Union (ITU), 
a specialized agency of the United Nations, is 
responsible for coordination and ensuring non-
interference of satellite frequency bands, under the 
authority of the international Radio Regulations 
treaty. The ITU is also where orbital slots, essentially 
the orbital positions, for satellites are assigned.24
Principles and norm-setting activities in various 
areas are also part of the broad space governance 
framework. Two UNGA resolutions address 
principles relevant to space communication 
technologies, albeit geared pragmatically toward 
communications between Earth and space rather 
than a network in deep space. These include the 
Broadcasting Principles (1982) and the Remote 
Sensing Principles (1986) — the former addressing 
“use by States of artificial Earth satellites for 
international direct television broadcasting”25 and 
the latter laying out “principles relating to remote 
sensing of the Earth from space.”26 Norm-setting and 
standards relevant to ICTs in space cover a diversity 
of other ad hoc areas such as best practices for 
commercial rendezvous and proximity operations, 
sustainability, and other guiding principles 
and standards developed by organizations 
such as the International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO), the Consortium for 
Execution of Rendezvous and Services Operations, 
and the Space Safety Coalition, among others. 
Satellites have also become the subject of norm-
setting commitments to refrain from direct-ascent 
missile tests. The United States announced in April 
2022 its commitment to refrain from conducting 
24 For a detailed description of ITU responsibility and also satellite 
governance more broadly, see Morozova and Vasyanin (2019).

direct-ascent ASAT, kinetic-energy missile tests and 
seek “to establish this as a new international norm 
for responsible behavior in space” (The White House 
2022). Shortly thereafter, a number of countries 
committed to follow suit, including Canada, 
Germany, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and 
the United Kingdom. Shortly thereafter, the UNGA 
adopted a draft resolution, “Destructive direct-
ascent anti-satellite missile testing” (document 
A/C.1/77/62), by a vote of 155 for, nine against 
and nine abstaining, calling “on all States not to 
conduct such tests and to continue discussions 
to develop further practical steps and contribute 
to legally binding instruments on the prevention 
of an arms race in outer space” (United Nations 
2022). The states voting against the resolution were 
Belarus, Bolivia, Central African Republic, Cuba, 
Iran, Nicaragua, the Russian Federation and Syria. 
These ASAT missile bans are not legally binding, 
at least as of this writing. But, whereas other 
security threats in the cyber realm have challenges 
with attribution, an easily seen and tracked 
direct-ascent attack on a communication satellite 
would have clearer attribution. These non-binding 
agreements also use very specific language 
around “kinetic” tests, meaning physical missiles 
striking a target, leaving potentially open other 
types of attacks. As Aaron Shull, Wesley Wark and 
Jessica West (2023) explain in their introduction 
to the CIGI essay series Cybersecurity and Outer 
Space: “The expansive and non-kinetic nature of 
harmful cyber activities in space means that they 
are generally considered below the threshold 
of warfighting. Yet ‘below threshold’ does not 
mean unimportant or lacking in danger.” 
As the UN Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) 
on reducing space threats through norms, rules 
and principles of responsible behaviours continues 
its work, it similarly focuses on voluntary, non-
legally binding approaches and multilateral space 
securitization issues such as disarmament and 
arms race in space, among other space governance 
topics. Non-kinetic attacks “such as cyber, 
electronic jamming, and directed energy or lasers” 
are part of the OEWG discussions (West 2023, 9).
RAND’s 2021 report, Responsible Space Behavior 
for the New Space Era: Preserving the Province 
of Humanity, explains that “Defining rules and 
norms for the responsible use of space has been 
a complicated and contentious issue that has 
been heavily influenced by national security 
interests over safety,” and that has to expand in the contemporary context to safety issues such 
as space traffic management, debris mitigation 
and ASAT testing, among other physical 
safety concerns (McClintock et al. 2021, 5). 
Applying and interpreting the rules of international 
law to the space domain, as Shull and Timiebi 
Aganaba (2023) explain, is already contentious 
and “almost always informed by geopolitical 
strategy, and strong states will interpret existing 
rules, or influence the creation of new ones, in a 
manner that benefits their geostrategic interests.” 
Despite the critical importance of networks 
in space — both for space applications and 
critical systems on Earth — there are primarily 
space governance treaties that predate the 
modern internet, along with a patchwork 
of multilateral agreements, principles and 
norm-setting activities that explicitly address 
ICT policy in deep space. The next section 
examines ways in which space governance 
might adapt to more directly and expansively 
include the internet governance domain. 
A Framework of 
Multistakeholder Internet 
Governance in Space 
Terrestrial internet governance is not “one thing” 
but rather an ecosystem of design and coordination 
functions. In 1999, Larry Lessig’s article, “The 
Law of the Horse: What Cyberspace Might 
Teach,” respectfully suggested the role of code in 
constituting rights in cyberspace, as well as laws, 
norms and markets, and how there is nothing to 
guarantee the politics constructed by that code. 
What is often overlooked in international treaties, 
laws and norm-setting is this policy-making role 
of arrangements of technical architecture. Taken 
together, the collectivity of design, coordination and 
oversight functions running the internet on Earth is 
usually referred to as “distributed, multistakeholder 12 CIGI Papers No. 277 — June 2023 • Laura DeNardis 
Internet governance,”27 a topic addressed by an 
enormous and venerable body of scholarship.28 
To examine the applicability and complexity 
of these functions in deep-space networks, 
this section uses as a lens a layered framework 
of terrestrial internet governance taken from 
the author’s work, including from The Global 
War for Internet Governance (DeNardis 2014) 
and Researching Internet Governance: Methods, 
Frameworks, Futures (DeNardis et al. 2020), among 
other articles and books.29 These six layers are: 
 →administration of critical internet resources 
(CIRs);
 →setting internet standards;
 →cybersecurity governance;
 →interconnection agreements;
 →the policy role of private intermediaries; and
 →government regulation and policies.
This section focuses on the first four of these 
layers because they specifically address technical 
design and governance areas not substantially 
addressed in space governance frameworks and 
because in space they so directly entangle with 
the other two layers. An examination of these 
layers can help inform the possible trajectory 
of governance of an interplanetary internet. 
Administration of CIRs
The internet, as designed, requires unique 
identifiers and so too will an interplanetary 
internet require a name and number space. In 
the terrestrial internet, these CIRs primarily 
include domain names, Internet Protocol (IP) 
addresses, autonomous system numbers (ASNs) 
and a variety of unique protocol numbers. 
Domain names are the globally unique, human-
27 On the topic of multistakeholder internet governance, see Hofmann 
(2020); Raymond and DeNardis (2015). 
28 On the policy-making role of private industry, see, for example, 
MacKinnon (2011); Klonick (2018). On the role of multistakeholder 
technical coordinating institutions, see, for example, Mueller (2002); 
Klein (2002); Kleinwächter (2000). On the role of international 
organizations, see Levinson and Marzouki (2015). On the role of 
technical design, see Braman (2011); Ermoshina and Musiani (2022). On 
the role of governments in internet governance, see, for example, Van 
Eeten and Mueller (2013); Goldsmith and Wu (2006).
29 See, for example, DeNardis (2013).readable, alphanumeric identifiers assigned 
to websites and other virtual resources. IP 
addresses are the unique binary numbers assigned 
uniquely, even if just for a session, to a device 
using the internet.30 The internet is a network 
of interconnected networks, technically called 
autonomous systems. ASNs are globally unique 
binary numbers assigned to these networks. 
Whether owned by a telecommunications provider 
such as AT&T, a large media company such as 
Google or a content distribution network such as 
Akamai, they each have a unique binary number 
that aids in interconnection among networks. 
This description of CIRs is oversimplified but serves 
to make the point that unique virtual identifiers are 
necessary for information to reach its destination 
over a network. Because each identifier on Earth 
has to be globally unique, someone has had to 
manage the distribution and use of these identifiers. 
But there are many other governance functions 
necessary to keep this entire system running: 
assigning domain names, allocating and assigning 
IP addresses, assigning protocol numbers, resolving 
DNS queries, operating root servers for each 
domain, authorizing changes to the root zone file, 
managing the root zone file, resolving domain name 
trademark disputes, securing the DNS, authorizing 
the use of new language scripts in the DNS and 
adjudicating domain name trademark disputes.
The institutions that carry out these tasks are 
similarly varied, including the Internet Corporation 
for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and 
its Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) 
functions; DNS registries; domain name registrars 
that assign names; domain name dispute resolution 
providers that resolve trademark disputes; and 
regional internet registries (RIRs) such as the 
African Network Information Centre, the Asia-
Pacific Network Information Centre, the American 
Registry for Internet Numbers, the Latin American 
and Caribbean Network Information Centre, and 
Réseaux IP Européens Network Coordination Centre 
(RIPE NCC) in Europe, the Middle East and Central 
Asia. Very little of this is controlled by governments 
in the contemporary context, in part because of 
30 There are two types of IP addresses: the historic Internet Protocol 
version 4 (IPv4) that assigns 32 bits (0s and 1s) to each address for a 
total IP address space of 232 or roughly 4.3 million unique addresses; 
and Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), the standard that dramatically 
increases the available pool of IP addresses by assigning 128 bits to each 
address for a total IPv6 address pool of 2128 or 340 undecillion available 
addresses (picture 340 followed by 36 zeros).13 Interplanetary Internet Governancehow the structures have evolved over time. In the 
same way, government involvement in the early 
coordination of space CIRs may follow suit.
A solar-system internet will have commensurate 
requirements for unique identifiers, for addressing 
of nodes, data, regions and eventually for network 
domains, among others. What will be the 
equivalent of IP addresses, protocol numbers and 
ASNs in space? For example, some leading early 
architectural efforts to design delay- and disruption-
tolerant protocols for deep-space environments 
indicate that IP addresses will be replaced by, or 
complemented by, Bundle Protocol addresses. 
Because of the expansiveness of space and 
multiple competing design efforts, it is not 
preordained that there will be a universal 
address space. Universality is a design choice 
and an issue of institutional cooperation. 
Another open governance question is whether the 
institutional complex overseeing the allocation 
and assignment of unique identifiers on Earth (i.e., 
ICANN, IANA, RIR, and so forth) will extend into 
space. This is a consequential question because 
it relates to the issue of whether there will be 
interoperability between the classical internet and 
solar-system networks. Already, there is an effort 
of completely distinct institutional jurisdiction 
materializing for space numbers. For example, the 
Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems 
(CCSDS), formed by the world’s major space 
agencies (including JAXA, ESA, NASA, CNSA, 
CSA and others) in 1982 to develop standards and 
solve common problems for space data systems, 
has established the Space Assigned Numbers 
Authority to register protocol identifiers and other 
standards-related identities (CCSDS 2020a). 
Another CIR governance function in deep space, 
and one requiring international coordination, is 
the allocation of electromagnetic spectrum and 
orbital slots. For satellites orbiting the Earth, 
orbital slots refer to the geostationary orbit (i.e., 
locations) at which satellites/spacecrafts are 
authorized to remain and operate. Radio-frequency 
spectrum, which similarly requires allocation 
coordination to avoid interference, is a finite 
resource necessary for satellite (and other wireless) 
communication. This could follow directly from 
near-Earth regulations and oversight. Coordination 
of these two functions, carried out by the UN 
specialized agency for telecommunications (the 
ITU), is necessary to circumvent interference. The ITU Radio Regulations is an international 
treaty with governance authority over a relevant 
portion of electromagnetic spectrum.31 The logic 
of this coordinating function extends to outer 
space, including inter-satellite communications.
It is less certain whether the DNS resolving names 
into numbers will extend into deep space, at 
least as currently designed. The back and forth 
of DNS query lookups may not be tenable over 
astronomical distances because of the latency 
involved. A domain name lookup that takes an 
hour is not acceptable in any context, and objects 
could have moved in the interim. In the long term, 
any system resolving names into numbers would 
either have to take place in a highly localized, 
store-and-forward approach, or be redesigned 
to reduce back-and-forth transmissions. 
The logic of coordinating and oversight functions 
for terrestrial and near-Earth internet governance 
will extend into space. Someone will have 
to assign unique identifiers and coordinate 
everything from deep-space orbital slots to 
unique numbers assigned to nodes, networks, 
data, sensors, actuators and regions of space. 
Some CIR governance functions in space reside 
far into the future, such as dealing with the space 
equivalent of domain name trademark disputes 
and whether a DNS function is needed at all. The 
question of how these identifiers are allocated, 
by whom and under what process, will likely be 
as economically and politically important and 
possibly as contentious as control of CIRs on Earth. 
Box 1 seeks to summarize some first-round CIR 
governance areas for an interplanetary internet. 
Setting Standards for an 
Interplanetary Internet
The design of technical standards is a core function 
of internet governance involving the creation 
of interoperability blueprints for all dimensions 
of digital information exchange, including 
encryption, error detection and correction, 
formatting, authenticating, encoding, addressing, 
routing, interconnection and more. Prior to the 
development of open internet standards such as 
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol 
(TCP/IP), networks connecting devices made by 
one company, such as Apple, were unable to easily 
31 The 2020 edition of the ITU Radio Regulations is available at www.itu.int/
pub/R-REG-RR-2020.14 CIGI Papers No. 277 — June 2023 • Laura DeNardis communicate with networks connecting devices 
made by another company, such as IBM. Each 
network used proprietary standards that were 
closed to other innovators. The core standards of 
the terrestrial internet, perhaps more than anything 
else, are what created the universal internet that 
is accessible from anywhere around the world 
and that serves as a substrate for applications 
as far ranging as the World Wide Web, video 
streaming, voice calls and online financial services. 
In order for an interplanetary internet to become 
a similar substrate for future applications and 
innovations not yet imaginable, it would similarly 
have to be built upon open standards that create 
interoperability, competition and universality. 
In space, as on Earth, there will also be tensions 
between the need for this openness and the need 
for protected and closed systems, whether for 
national security purposes or national economic 
advantage. For many future applications and 
maximum human benefit, interoperability with the terrestrial internet is necessary. Given the 
need to redesign technology to meet unique 
space conditions and given political tensions 
between major spacefaring nations, achieving 
this interoperability may face challenges. 
There is not “one protocol” that standardizes the 
internet but countless, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 
Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, Secure Sockets 
Layer, TCP/IP, BGP, Joint Photographic Experts 
Group, Moving Picture Experts Group, Voice over 
Internet Protocol, IPv6, H.323, Internet Protocol 
Security, Transport Layer Security, Domain Name 
System Security Extensions, IPv4, American 
Standard Code for Information Interchange, 
Unicode, near-field communication, Pretty Good 
Privacy (PGP), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, 
OpenPGP, 6in4, Real-time Transport Protocol, 
Internet Message Access Protocol and countless 
others. The IETF, responsible for establishing 
core internet protocols and making them openly 
available via the Request for Comments (RFC) 
series, is one of numerous standards-setting 
institutions developing specifications for digital 
technologies. Some of these include the World Wide 
Web Consortium, ISO and the Institute of Electrical 
and Electronics Engineers, among many others.
A solar-system internet will also not be built 
upon one single standard but a constellation of 
standards that address various requirements. 
Because of the unique space requirements outlined 
in the first section, this architecture will not 
simply be a replication of the classical internet. 
The core networking standards of the internet 
require significant adjustments to accommodate 
the unique conditions in deep space such as 
signal delay and environmental disruption. 
Standards efforts are under way to develop delay-
tolerant network architectures (Cerf et al. 2007). 
IETF engineers working in the Delay-Tolerant 
Networking Research Group of the Internet 
Research Task Force have been developing 
protocols designed to address constant network 
interruptions, such as by introducing persistent 
storage on network nodes and building in 
both diagnostic and management features 
designed to provide network reliability and 
stability. As RFC 9171 explains, “Delay-Tolerant 
Networking is a network architecture providing 
communications in and/or through highly 
stressed environments. Stressed networking 
environments include those with intermittent Box 1: First-Round CIR Governance for a

bit error rates” (Burleigh, Fall and Birrane 2022). 
A separate standardization effort is under 
way in the CCSDS of ISO. The committee has 
developed many technical specifications 
for information systems in space.32 
An open governance question is whether the 
core standards under way for space networks 
are encumbered with standards-based patents, 
a concern with implications for innovation, 
competition and also the question of change 
control over standards in the future. 
At a higher level of standards governance, the 
larger question is what institution becomes 
the authority for developing standards for an 
interplanetary internet (see Box 2). In the terrestrial 
digital ecosystem, there are multiple standards-
setting institutions focusing on different aspects 
of standardization, with the IETF developing core 
internet standards. At the early stage of design, 
there are arguments for multiple organizations in 
innovation competition. There are also important 
rationales for cooperation and bringing together 
expertise from different design communities. As 
an Interplanetary Networking Special Interest 
Group report rightly expresses in the context of 
dual efforts in the IETF and the CCSDS, “There is an 
open question regarding the management authority 
of the standards: which standards organization is 
the proper authority for developing and publishing 
standards and ensuring that implementations 
conform to them?” (Kaneko et al. 2021, 28).
Cybersecurity Governance 
Securing the core, common infrastructure 
underlying all digital transactions remains 
one of the most critical functions of internet 
governance. This includes securing systems of 
routing; securing the DNS; authenticating websites 
using public key cryptography and trusted 
third-party certificate authorities; defending 
critical internet sites against distributed denial 
of service attacks, viruses, worms, disruptions, 
ransomware, and unauthorized eavesdropping 
and use; and authenticating handoffs among 
network operators. The design, implementation, 
coordination and regulation of internet security 
span multiple institutions, both private and public.
32 To gain a sense of this work, see, for example, CCSDS (2020b). Space communication technologies have already  
become, in practice, part of critical infrastructure, 
necessary for vital transactions and services 
on Earth and part of the apparatus of national 
security. The security requirements for the classical 
internet all extend into the critical space domain: 
confidentiality and integrity of information; 
strong authentication of nodes; protection from 
attack; and trusted handoffs among networks. 
33 As Corinne Cath (2023, 8) elaborates, there can also be a “disconnect 
between procedural openness and actual accessibility,” rooted in culture, 
as well as economic and technical barriers to participation.Box 2: First-Round Standards

Internet

programs. 16 CIGI Papers No. 277 — June 2023 • Laura DeNardis An open question is whether to build in a stronger 
identity system to authenticate who is using the 
solar-system network, an attribute that would 
facilitate attribution and accountability, on one 
hand, but raise privacy and speech questions, 
on the other. Trust and security architectures 
trailed the commercialization and global reach 
of the internet. It is possible that a deep-space 
network will have a security advantage in that 
strong security can be engineered in from the 
beginning. But a crucial design concern for strong 
encryption and authentication — whether via 
public-key cryptography, emerging blockchain 
frameworks, quantum-resistant algorithms 
or another approach — is the requirement for 
working over long distances. Governments have 
historically tried to weaken encryption to carry 
out surveillance, intelligence, counterterrorism 
and law enforcement functions. The same tensions 
among sometimes conflicting values — critical 
infrastructure security versus intelligence 
gathering, for example — will extend to space, 
only with additional sovereignty complexities. 
Many institutional forms of cybersecurity 
governance34 could have important applications 
in space. Computer emergency response 
teams (CERTs) or computer security incident 
response teams (CSIRTs) are public-private 
institutions that notify the public of software 
vulnerabilities, cybersecurity incidents 
and the need for updates. They pass along 
security bulletins from the private sector and 
information about mitigating vulnerabilities. 
A CERT devoted to space-cyber vulnerabilities, 
incidents and responses is a novel and possibly 
important idea as space networking evolves. 
Certificate authorities are another category of 
internet governance institution that could be 
critical for a solar-system internet. These trusted 
third parties vouch for the digital certificates 
necessary for public-key cryptography, certifying 
identities, information, websites and networks. 
This area is as problematic as it is important. 
A fundamental governance question is what 
makes these third parties trustworthy enough 
to perform this function. A system of trusted 
third-party digital signature verification for space 
may face similar challenges, but is essential 
for creating the requisite trust architectures.
34 For a detailed account of cybersecurity governance, see DeNardis (2014, 
chapter 4). Concerns about cyberwar and cybersecurity 
attacks carried out by a multitude of players, 
regrettably, also will convey into space. Carrying 
out deception, intelligence gathering and 
surveillance, and disruptions in space will be part 
of the cyberwarfare domain. Discussions about 
responsible state behaviour in space usually 
focus on physical attacks. Even when discussing 
satellites, the focus is often on kinetic attacks. 
Whether or not this is intentional, this leaves out 
virtual attacks of all kinds (see Box 3). Cyberattacks 
can achieve the same effects of taking down 
satellites or causing commensurate disruptions. 
An open governance question is whether nation-
states will agree to refrain from cyber disruptions.

Although the internet is metaphorically described 
as a “cloud,” it is, of course, a network of networks. 
These networks do not just connect. They 
are deliberately interconnected via technical 
protocols, physical interconnection, and largely 
private contractual agreements among network 
operators to conjoin their networks either 
bilaterally or at IXPs. This is a highly privatized area 
involving both physical and logical connections 
and business agreements to exchange packets 
between autonomous systems. On Earth, 
the types of businesses interconnecting are 
network providers, large content companies and 
content delivery networks. Because decisions to 
interconnect are usually privately negotiated, 
this is an internet governance area with little 
transparency. In general, these agreements to 
exchange information can involve settlement-free 
peering, paid peering or paid transit agreements 
in which one operator pays another to exchange 
traffic. There is not considerable regulatory 
oversight of these interconnection agreements, 
or of IXPs, and they raise public policy concerns 
about competition, antitrust, points of disruption 
and surveillance, and digital inclusion.35 
Networks are able to interconnect to form the 
global internet because of the common use of 
an inter-domain routing protocol called BGP. 
This protocol allows each autonomous system 
to exchange a complete accounting of routing 
information, or what resources are reachable via 
their networks. The historic basis of this structure 
is trust among networks and, as the internet 
has evolved, BGP and interconnection have 
become a vulnerable part of digital infrastructure 
(Fraire 2017, 124–27). False routing information 
injected into the system has caused disruptions, 
deceptions and outages, and resulted occasionally 
in rerouting of transmissions through faraway 
countries, whether accidentally or from a 
politically motivated act. Ongoing efforts to secure 
interconnection via public key cryptography have 
been under way, but raise difficult infinite regress 
questions around trust such as what trusted third 
party should validate these encryption keys. 
The interplanetary internet will also be a 
network of networks, with the same governance 
and coordination requirements — securing 
35 For a detailed account of interconnection architecture and policy, see 
DeNardis (2014, chapter 5).and authenticating exchanges, agreeing on 
interoperability standards, establishing financial 
terms for interconnection — along with many, 
many more complications. Perhaps more than 
any other area of internet governance, there 
are stunning technical and political differences 
between interconnection on Earth and in deep 
space, even beyond the shift from a constellation 
of physical fibre optic, twisted pair, and coaxial 
cable and wireless (cellular, microwave, Wi-Fi 
and satellite) approaches, to entirely wireless 
transmission, including both radio-frequency 
and optical communication. Governments with 
advanced space programs, or public-private 
partnerships, rather than private businesses 
will likely make these initial investments. A 
more consequential shift is that interconnection 
needs to assume intermittent and variable 
connectivity. All objects are continuously moving 
relative to each other, causing connectivity 
variability and disruptions beyond outages from 
exogenous natural (solar flares, micrometeoroid) 
and human-made (orbital debris) factors. 
Deep-space interconnection needs to account for 
relative positional movement and intermittent 
disruptions, requiring store-and-forward capability 
but also continuous predictive information 
about when devices are positionally capable of 
communications. Rather than assuming always-
connected interconnection, whether bilaterally or 
at multi-network exchange points, interconnection 
will require “contact plan” information about 
“episodes of communications” or simply “an 
opportunity to establish a temporal communication 
link” (ibid.). Procedures and institutional 
responsibility for developing these contact plans 
will be a critical new governance function.  
It cannot be assumed that national space program 
networks or private-public partnerships will have 
incentives to interconnect their networks because 
of national security, mission safety and other 
concerns. But if they do not, whether through 
radical air-gapping of networks or the use of closed 
proprietary specifications rather than shared 
standards, the ensuing networks will emulate the 
proprietary systems of the twentieth century rather 
than a public-purpose, multi-use solar-system 
network for shared discovery and exploration. 
Engineering and coordinating high systems 
of interconnection security — even if within 
multiple independent networks — is a prerequisite 
for interconnection progress (see Box 4). 18 CIGI Papers No. 277 — June 2023 • Laura DeNardis Internet Governance 
Flashpoints Applicable in 
Space 
Deep-space exploration and discovery will not 
exist without a reliable communication network 
that is multipurpose, interoperable and secure. 
While this paper has sought to suggest a layered 
framework of internet governance decisions likely 
applicable to deep space, it can also be assumed 
that many of the controversial internet governance 
flashpoints on Earth will also extend into space in 
the next half century. Drawing from the history of 
internet governance themes and controversies, the 
following are anticipated flashpoints that could 
help inform interplanetary internet governance. 
Conflicts Will Likely Emerge 
Over Control of a Common 
Addressing Scheme
IP addresses such as the IPv4 address 11000000
010100011000001110100001, usually written in 
shorthand dotted-decimal notation such as, for this 
address, 192.81.131.161, seem as uncontroversial as 
imaginable. Yet control and oversight of internet 
addresses and other critical resources have arguably 
been as historically contentious as more obviously 
political issues such as government censorship 
and surveillance. The so-called IANA functions 
allocating unique addresses were once carried out 
by a single individual, Jon Postel, before evolving 
into an institutional system eventually around 
ICANN with oversight by the US Department 
of Commerce. After years of global debate, and 
with some American politicians describing the 
transition as America’s internet surrender, the 
functions transitioned to the ICANN-administered 
system. The technological affordances of unique 
identifiers — criticality, finite resources, global 
uniqueness — somewhat explain the attending 
controversies. IP addresses are necessary for nearly 
all social, economic and political transactions over 
digital networks, hence the political and economic 
interest in control of the finite pool of these 
resources, metaphorically or pragmatically. These 
identifiers, because of the requirement of global 
uniqueness for each session, have also morphed 
into personal identifiers, at least when combined 
with other information such as that provided by a network operator. IP addresses, and certainly 
the DNS, have also become a site of filtering and 
blocking. IP continues to be politicized, including 
movements from China to create a “new IP.”  
These same types of control struggles and 
politicization of addressing — including the 
question of whether there even will or should 
be a common addressing system across 
adversarial states — should be anticipated 
for the CIRs and unique identification 
systems in a solar-system internet.Box 4: First-Round Interconnection

of a BGP-like standard for exchanging 
information among space domains and 
networks.

technical plan and institutional structure 
for authenticating nodes and reachability 
information.
 →Network identification architecture: 
related to CIR recommendations above, 
i.e., establishment of a unique numbering 
system for identification of space 
networks, regions or segments.
 →Peering agreements: establishing

contracts in the terrestrial internet, 
including government agreements on 
interconnection of mission-related 
networks.
 →Contact plans: a technical and 
institutional procedure for calculating, 
developing and disseminating “contact 
plans,” the temporal and spatial 
opportunities for communications 
between moving and intermittently 
connected objects.19 Interplanetary Internet GovernanceInteroperability, Including 
with the Classical Internet, 
Is Not Preordained
The architecture of an interplanetary internet 
will be novel because of the technical constraints 
and unique contexts of space, such as delay and 
disruption tolerance. Creating interoperability 
with the classical internet is not at all preordained, 
but something that has to be designed. Without 
this backward compatibility, the discovery, 
education, commercial and exploration benefits of 
space networks will be more limited. Challenges 
implementing IPv6 on Earth ensued because of 
the lack of backward compatibility between IPv4 
and IPv6, as well as other complicating factors.36 
Building native Earth-space interoperability into 
the completely redesigned architectures may 
be infeasible because of the many necessary 
space adaptations, so translation mechanisms 
and other technological bridges will likely be 
necessary for achieving interoperability.
Avoiding Fragmentation Requires 
Standards Harmonization
Other rapidly emerging internet landscapes, 
such as around the IoT and quantum-resistant 
communication technologies are, to various 
degrees, fragmented and carried out by 
multiple competing standards institutions 
doing the same work.37 The standards landscape 
materializing around networks in space may be 
similarly heterogenous and fragmented. While 
this competition and incompatibility may be 
inevitable, and even helpful, for maximizing 
innovation in the contemporary moment, avoiding 
fragmentation and incompatible networks (and 
duplicative investment) later requires some 
international coordination and harmonization, 
possibly incentivized by government 
procurement policies or security frameworks. 
Change control struggles over standards, and 
tensions around institutional authority over 
standardization, have been a recurrent theme 
in internet governance, certainly since the 
1990s tensions between the Open Systems 
Interconnection (OSI) protocols and the TCP/  IP 
suite that would form the basis of the global

IPv6, see DeNardis (2009). 
37 See, for example, DeNardis (2020, chapter 5). internet. It is worth noting that the two key 
standards communities involved in these historic 
efforts, the IETF and ISO, are also involved in 
current efforts to develop space network protocols. 
Open Standards Are Necessary 
Now for Private Investment Later
The availability of open standards — openly 
developed, openly published and unencumbered 
by standards-based patents — has contributed 
to the rapid growth and innovation around the 
global internet.38 Yet there has always remained 
a tension between this openness and proprietary 
enclosure, whether in social media services, 
hardware or the IoT. The private investment 
eventually necessary for the development, 
adoption and use of a solar-system internet will 
depend, in part, upon architectural openness, the 
assurance that a software or hardware product 
developed will interoperate with other products 
or that a network will interoperate with another 
network. Historically, open standards have 
shaped economic competition and inclusion. If 
different solar-system networks are based on 
IPR-encumbered standards, or completely closed 
unpublished specifications, there will likely not be 
competitive investment in a solar-system internet.
Standardization Does Not Assure 
Implementation or Usage
Internet history is replete with examples 
of widely touted standards that were never 
adopted into product development or 
widespread usage. The highest-profile example 
of this may be the OSI protocol suite that many 
governments and businesses considered a 
solution to moving from proprietary network 
architectures to universal interoperability. 
Instead, the TCP/  IP standards emerged as the 
foundational basis for interoperability from 
the principle of rough consensus and working 
code.39 Standards are blueprints. To be used, 
they require proven concepts, implementation 
in products and also adoption. As various 
concurrent efforts at space standardization 
continue, history suggests that some may never 
translate into implementation and use. 
38 For a detailed account of open standards and global interoperability, see 
DeNardis (2011). 
39 For one account of the history of TCP/IP versus OSI, see Russell (2014). 20 CIGI Papers No. 277 — June 2023 • Laura DeNardis Technical Governance in Space 
Will Become Highly Politicized
Because technical design often makes public 
policy decisions, and because of the security 
and economic stakes of deep-space networking, 
design efforts will likely be politicized. This has 
happened throughout the development of digital 
technologies. Encryption architectures, and 
especially encryption key strength, have remained 
at the centre of conflicts between the public 
policy goal of securing critical infrastructure and 
the objective of weakening encryption for law 
enforcement and intelligence functions. Part of the 
essential tension exists between cyber offence and 
defence. Should space networks be “air gapped” 
or should they inherently be interoperable and 
overlaid with tight security? All of the cyberwar 
tensions that exist on Earth, such as governmental 
calculations about when to stockpile zero-  day 
exploits for cyber offence versus when to disclose 
them to increase cybersecurity, will also exist 
in space. So too will critical debates about 
environmental concerns and natural resources that 
directly connect to and extend into space contexts.  
The tension between multilateral and 
multistakeholder models of governance will also 
leap into space. Throughout internet history, 
there have been incommensurable world views 
about technology governance and especially 
tensions between cybersovereignty approaches 
versus more distributed models. Because national 
space programs are leading initial investments 
in space networking, and because of inherent 
competition among national space programs, this 
tension between so-called cybersovereignty versus 
multistakeholder governance can be expected. The 
strange distinction between cyber and internet on 
Earth, which makes little engineering sense because 
the technical architecture is the same, will likely 
carry over into space, with one group primarily 
focused on national security and cyberwar. Infrastructures of Internet 
Governance in Space Will 
Be Co-opted as a Proxy 
for Political Power
In the same way the DNS is regularly co-opted 
by governments and companies for content 
control, such as carrying out political censorship 
or enforcing IPR, so too might infrastructures of 
internet governance in space be co-opted as a 
proxy for heliopolitical power. Governments turn 
to infrastructure companies and coordinating 
institutions (hosting services, network operators, 
platforms, domain name registries) to carry out 
everything from disruptions to surveillance. In 
the immediate aftermath of the Russian invasion 
of Ukraine, the Ukrainian deputy minister of 
digital transformation asked both ICANN and RIPE 
NCC (the relevant regional internet registry) to 
essentially disconnect Russia from the internet.40 
The institutions declined to do so for a variety 
of technical and procedural reasons. Because 
of the sui generis strategic importance of space 
networks and also the strategic importance of 
space networks to national security, societal 
functioning and the economy on Earth, emerging 
space networks will also become a target for 
carrying out political objectives having nothing to 
do with the networks’ original operational mission. 
This historic pattern in internet governance 
emphasizes the need for international cooperation 
and treaties around space networks, as well as 
strong cybersecurity to mitigate against politically 
motivated disruptions and other interventions.

Governance and Internet 
Governance
In the same way technology constantly evolves, 
so too must technology governance evolve. This 
paper has explored some unique constraints of 
space that will shape interplanetary internet 
governance, assessed the relevance of international 
space treaties to deep-space networks, suggested 
an initial layered framework of internet governance 
applicable in space, and closed with some 
terrestrial internet governance themes that 
might help inform nascent structures and efforts 
around interplanetary internet governance. 
The communities involved in space governance writ 
large are not the same communities involved in 
internet governance, so a first step is to bring these 
expert communities into conversation. The internet 
is making a leap off Earth into outer space. Space 
governance frameworks must evolve to incorporate 
internet governance. So too must internet 
governance evolve to meet the space moment.
