January 14, 2025 27 CommentsMicrosoft: Happy 2025. Here’ s 161 Security
Updates
Microsoft  today unleashed updates to plug a whopping 161 security vulnerabilities in Windows
and related software, including three “zero-day” weaknesses that are already under active attack.
Redmond’ s inaugural Patch Tuesday of 2025 bundles more ﬁxes than the company has shipped
in one go since 2017.

https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/01/microsoft-happy-2025-heres-161-security-updates/ 1/9Rapid7 ‘s Adam Barnett  says January marks the fourth consecutive month where Microsoft has
published zero-day vulnerabilities on Patch Tuesday without evaluating any of them as critical
severity at time of publication. Today also saw the publication of nine critical remote code
execution (RCE) vulnerabilities.
The Microsoft ﬂaws already seeing active attacks include CVE-2025-21333 , CVE-2025-21334
and, you guessed it– CVE-2025-21335 . These are sequential because all reside in Windows
Hyper-V , a component that is heavily embedded in modern Windows 1 1 operating systems and
used for security features including device guard and credential guard.
Tenable’ s Satnam Narang  says little is known about the in-the-wild exploitation of these ﬂaws,
apart from the fact that they are all “privilege escalation” vulnerabilities. Narang said we tend to
see a lot of elevation of privilege bugs exploited in the wild as zero-days in Patch Tuesday
because it’ s not always initial access to a system that’ s a challenge for attackers as they have
various avenues in their pursuit.
“As elevation of privilege bugs, they’re being used as part of post-compromise activity , where an
attacker has already accessed a target system,” he said. “It’ s kind of like if an attacker is able to
enter a secure building, they’re unable to access more secure parts of the facility because they
have to prove that they have clearance. In this case, they’re able to trick the system into believing
they should have clearance.”3/5/25, 10:27 AM Microsoft: Happy 2025. Here’s 161 Security Updates – Krebs on Security
https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/01/microsoft-happy-2025-heres-161-security-updates/ 2/9Several bugs addressed today earned CVSS (threat rating) scores of 9.8 out of a possible 10,
including CVE-2025-21298 , a weakness in Windows that could allow attackers to run arbitrary
code by getting a target to open a malicious .rtf ﬁle, documents typically opened on Ofﬁce
applications like Microsoft W ord. Microsoft has rated this ﬂaw “exploitation more likely .”
Ben Hopkins  at Immersive Labs  called attention to the CVE-2025-2131 1, a 9.8 “critical” bug in
Windows NTLMv1  (NT LAN Manager version 1), an older Microsoft authentication protocol that
is still used by many organizations.
“What makes this vulnerability so impactful is the fact that it is remotely exploitable, so attackers
can reach the compromised machine(s) over the internet, and the attacker does not need
signiﬁcant knowledge or skills to achieve repeatable success with the same payload across any
vulnerable component,” Hopkins wrote.
Kev Breen  at Immersive points to an interesting ﬂaw ( CVE-2025-21210 ) that Microsoft ﬁxed in its
full disk encryption suite Bitlocker  that the software giant has dubbed “exploitation more likely .”
Speciﬁcally , this bug holds out the possibility that in some situations the hibernation image created
when one closes the laptop lid on an open Windows session may not be fully encrypted and could
be recovered in plain text.
“Hibernation images are used when a laptop goes to sleep and contains the contents that were
stored in RAM at the moment the device powered down,” Breen noted. “This presents a
signiﬁcant potential impact as RAM can contain sensitive data (such as passwords, credentials
and PII) that may have been in open documents or browser sessions and can all be recovered
with free tools from hibernation ﬁles.”
Tenable’ s Narang also highlighted a trio of vulnerabilities in Microsoft Access  ﬁxed this month
and credited to Unpatched.ai, a security research ef fort that is aided by artiﬁcial intelligence
looking for vulnerabilities in code. Tracked as CVE-2025-21 186, CVE-2025-21366 , and CVE-
2025-21395 , these are remote code execution bugs that are exploitable if an attacker convinces a
target to download and run a malicious ﬁle through social engineering. Unpatched.ai was also
credited with discovering a ﬂaw in the December 2024 Patch Tuesday release ( CVE-2024-49142 ).
“Automated vulnerability detection using AI has garnered a lot of attention recently , so it’ s
noteworthy to see this service being credited with ﬁnding bugs in Microsoft products,” Narang
observed. “It may be the ﬁrst of many in 2025.”
If you’re a Windows user who has automatic updates turned of f and haven’t updated in a while,
it’s probably time to play catch up. Please consider backing up important ﬁles and/or the entire
hard drive before updating. And if you run into any problems installing this month’ s patch batch,

Based on the wording from Microsoft, CVE-2025-21298 doesn’t appear to require users to
actually open the R TF ﬁles as currently-worded in this article (such as those that arrive as an
email attachment). The vulnerability seems to be related to OLE such that Outlook is af fected, so
all the attacker needs to do is send a specially-crafted email to a target that uses Outlook. This is
a somewhat important distinction (speciﬁc user interaction not being required) and I believe is
part of why it’ s rated at a 9.8.Oliver

Speaking of Microsoft, there is a current article about some dodgy code in the 6.13 kernel
submitted by a Microsoft engineer that could have caused serious issues with some systems.
A funny headline about the issue: “Microsoft pulls a Windows as it breaks Linux on Intel CPUs
and angers AMD in the process”
I just bought a Lenovo neo 50t. It runs Ubuntu Pro 24.04, but sometimes it has to by force when
it comes to Windows. It is a dual boot machine, with Windows 1 1 Pro on another partition. On
install, and now apparently on Update Tuesday , 11 Pro decides to diddle with the boot sequence
in UEFI and place itself ﬁrst. That forces me to go back into UEFI and change the boot
sequence. Even with a supervisor password on UEFI.Uncle Jack
