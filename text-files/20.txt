Abstract—This paper considers opportunistic primary-
secondary spectrum sharing when the primary is a ro tating 
radar.  A secondary device is allowed to transmit w hen its 
resulting interference will not exceed the radar’s tolerable level, 
in contrast to current approaches that prohibit sec ondary 
transmissions if radar signals are detected at any time.  We 
consider the case where an OFDMA based secondary sy stem 
operates in non-contiguous cells, as might occur wi th a 
broadband hotspot service, or a cellular system tha t uses 
spectrum shared with radar to supplement its dedica ted 
spectrum.  It is shown that even fairly close to a radar, extensive 
secondary transmissions are possible, although with  some 
interruptions and fluctuations as the radar rotates .  For example, 
at 27% of the distance at which secondary transmiss ions will not 
affect the radar, on average, the achievable second ary data rates 
in down- and upstream are around 100% and 63% of th e one 
that will be achieved in dedicated spectrum, respec tively.  
Moreover, extensive secondary transmissions are sti ll possible 
even at different values of key system parameters, including cell 
radius, transmit power, tolerable interference leve l, and radar 
rotating period.  By evaluating quality of service,  it is found that 
spectrum shared with radar could be used efficientl y for 
applications such as non-interactive video on deman d, peer-to-
peer file sharing, file transfers, and web browsing , but not for 
applications such as real-time transfers of small f iles and VoIP.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
RIMARY -SECONDARY  spectrum sharing can substantially 
alleviate spectrum scarcity [1].  Radars could be a  good 
candidate for the primary systems in spectrum shari ng because 
they operate in a large amount of spectrum.  For ex ample, in

L.M. Correia is with Instituto Superior Técnico/Ins tituto de 
Telecomunicações – Technical University of Lisbon (e -mail: 
luis.correia@lx.it.pt). around 1.1 GHz of this 1.7 GHz is used by fixed lan d-based 
radars in non-military applications [3].  
This paper considers opportunistic sharing where a 
secondary device can transmit only when its transmi ssions 
will not cause harmful interference , i.e., interference that 
causes noticeable service disruption to the primary  [4].  
Currently, there are some bands in which radars are  
protected from harmful interference by granting the m 
exclusive rights to operate in a given area and fre quency band, 
and other bands (e.g., at 5 GHz) in which radars sh are 
spectrum with unlicensed devices that can transmit only if 
they are so far from any radar that the radar is un detectable 
[5].  Both of these are white space  approaches to primary-
secondary sharing, where secondary wireless systems  are 
allowed to operate in frequency bands and geographi c regions 
that are found to be entirely “unused” by any prima ry system.  
In contrast, with the gray space sharing  [6] considered in this 
paper, a secondary device is allowed to transmit ne ar a radar, 
but only when and with a transmit power that will n ot cause 
harmful interference.  The maximum transmit power o f 
secondary devices changes over time, based on the b ehavior of 
the primary system.  We have previously used this a pproach to 
prevent a secondary spectrum user from causing harm ful 
interference to a primary user, when the primary wa s a cellular 
system [7].  Dynamic power control has long been us ed to 
control devices within a single communication syste m, e.g., a 
cellular network, but here it is used to allow syst ems under 
different administrative control to share spectrum in a 
primary-secondary arrangement.  
We investigate how much the secondary system can 
transmit with this different sharing concept, by co nsidering 
sharing with a rotating radar.  Examples of these r adars 
include applications in weather operating in [2.7, 3.0] GHz, 
Air Traffic Control (ATC) in [2.7, 2.9] GHz, and ot her 
surveillance in [0.42, 0.45] GHz and [2.7, 3.5] GHz  [3].  With 
a rotating main beam, the radar antenna gain seen b y the fixed 
secondary device varies, hence, there will be perio ds of time 
when the link loss (including antenna gains and pat h loss) 
between the device and the radar is high enough so that the 
device can transmit successfully, without causing h armful 
interference to the radar.  This sharing can be eit her 
cooperative  (through explicit coordination between the 
secondary device and the primary system) or coexistent  
(without coordination) [1].

adjacent cells is considered; two examples are a se condary 
system providing broadband hotspots, and a cellular  system 
using shared spectrum when a traffic surge temporar ily 
exceeds what can be supported in dedicated spectrum .. 
Only a few previous studies have addressed spectrum  
sharing with a rotating radar.  Marcus qualitativel y discussed 
the possibility in [8]; Wang et al. [9], and later Rahman and 
Karlsson [10], analyzed coexistent sharing quantita tively, but 
only when a device is far enough that its transmiss ions will not 
cause harmful interference even in the radar’s main  beam, as 
occurs in 5 GHz band.  Instead, the proposed sharin g makes 
use of the varying link loss between the radar and a secondary 
device, hence, a device may transmit at a closer di stance to the 
radar, but with some interruptions and fluctuations  in 
transmissions as the radar rotates.  
We quantify the extent of secondary transmissions, and 
characterize the effect of interruptions and fluctu ations on 
secondary transmissions.  Performance is analyzed f or six 
applications from the four classes of services [11] : 1) Voice-
over-IP (VoIP, conversational ), 2) non-interactive video on 
demand ( streaming ), 3) Peer-to-Peer file sharing (P2P, 
background ), 4) automatic meter reading (e.g., electricity 
meter reading, background ), 5) file transfer ( interactive , with 
traffic in both up- and downstreams), and 6) web br owsing 
(interactive , with traffic mostly in downstream).   
The sharing scenario is described in Section II.  T he power 
level that a secondary device will be allowed to tr ansmit and 
the resulting SINR (Signal to Interference plus Noi se Ratio) 
are derived in Section III.  Parameters used to eva luate 
performance of the sharing, numerical results, and conclusions 
are discussed in Sections IV, V, and VI, respective ly. 
II.  SPECTRUM SHARING SCENARIO  
To quantify the overall extent of secondary transmi ssions, a 
canonical case is considered where there is one rad ar, one 
secondary Base Station (BS), and one secondary Mobi le 
Terminal (MT), as shown in Fig. 1. The BS is /G740/Gbcb/Gbd7/Gb3>/Gbbb/Gbcc  away 
from the radar, and the MT is /G740/Gbbb/Gbcc/Gb3>/Gbc6/Gbcd  from the BS.  Both BS 
and MT are called secondary devices (SDs). 
  
 
Figure 1 - Sharing Scenario. 
 
The radar uses the same antenna for transmission an d 
reception.  The radar’s main beam rotates, hence, t he radar’s 
radiation pattern seen by an SD, depends on the ang le between 
its main beam and the SD.  The rotation can be eith er 
mechanical as when a radar antenna rotates, or elec tronic as 
when phased array is used.  The radar transmits a s eries of 
pulses with constant power, and detects echoes from  its 
surroundings [12]. We assume that the SD knows either the instantaneou s 
antenna gain of the radar together with the expecte d value of 
path loss between itself and the radar, or the summ ation of the 
two, and that the SD can remain synchronized with t he main 
beam rotation.  The instantaneous path loss may dif fer from 
the expected value due to fading and other factors.   The SD 
can determine this loss in a variety of ways, depen ding on the 
sharing approach and type of radar.  For example, f or a typical 
ATC radar (rotating horizontally with a constant sp eed), in a 
sharing scheme based only on coexistence, the SD ma y 
combine any a priori knowledge of the radar with ob servations 
over numerous rotations to determine the periodic p attern of 
the expected link loss, which includes antenna gain s of the 
secondary device and the radar, and the expected pa th loss.  
Alternatively, some observations can be replaced by  
cooperative sharing, which allows the radar to expl icitly 
inform SDs about patterns.  The situation is more c omplicated 
with a weather radar, which scans in both horizonta l and 
vertical planes at a speed that may change when a s torm is 
approaching [13], or a tracking radar, which may su ddenly 
change the direction of its main beam in response t o a target’s 
movements.  Cooperative schemes are more useful in such 
cases.  With or without cooperation, the SD should stop 
transmitting, and resynchronize if the monitored ro tation 
pattern appears to change unexpectedly.  The possib ility of 
synchronization errors is beyond the scope of this paper.  
A radar insidiously misdetects targets if the inter ference 
level is high enough to disrupt its echo receptions  [14].  To 
protect radars from harmful interference, a maximum  in-band 
Interference-to-Noise Ratio (INR) is defined (e.g.,  by [13]) 
below which the radar’s detection performance is la rgely 
unaffected, and INR must be kept below this limit w ith 
sufficiently high probability.  Many radar systems are used in 
applications that affect people’s lives, so prevent ing harmful 
interference in these cases is especially important .  For 
example, recently in the UK there has been discussi on on the 
risk of inadvertent interference to aviation radars  operating in 
the 2.7 GHz band from LTE operating in 2.6 GHz [15] .  
We assume that the secondary system uses Orthogonal  
Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), which i s used 
in wireless communication systems such as LTE.  How ever, 
the proposed sharing model could be applicable to o ther 
secondary systems as well.  The proposed sharing mo del 
assumes that: 1) Some information of the radar, suc h as pulse 
power, rotating period, and tolerable interference level, is 
known to the secondary system (these parameters rar ely 
change over time); 2) The secondary system: a) uses  Time 
Division Duplex (TDD), b) will use as much availabl e 
bandwidth as possible, c) can always transmit signa ling traffic 
without causing harmful interference to a radar (th is could 
easily happen, e.g., if signaling is transmitted in  a frequency 
band different from the one shared with the radar).  
There are additional assumptions on the secondary 
applications: 1) signaling traffic is negligible, 2 ) time used to 
transfer data within networks (i.e., network delay)  is negligible 
compared to the time used to transfer the data betw een MT 
and BS, 3) MTs using video on demand have enough me mory

for buffering, and a constant streaming rate is use d. 
III.  SECONDARY MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE TRANSMIT POWER 
AND ACHIEVABLE SINR   
An SD determines its maximum allowable transmit pow er, 
/G73×/Gbcc,/Gbe0/Gbd4/Gbeb , from the radar’s tolerable level /G7×b/Gbe7/Gbe×/Gbd>  (which is known to 
the SD,  assumption 1 in Section II), and the expec ted link loss 
between itself and the radar, which varies dependin g on 
azimuthal angle between the radar’s main beam and t he 
device, /G7ee.  When one secondary transmitter is using as much 
bandwidth as possible (assumption 2), from /G7×b/Gbe7/Gbe×/Gbd> , the SD at 
distance /G740/Gbcb/Gbd7/Gb3>/Gbcc from a radar can determine /G73×/Gbcc,/Gbe0/Gbd4/Gbeb  as 
 
/G73×/Gbcc,/Gbe0/Gbd4/Gbeb /G1×3a/G7ee,/G740/Gbcb/Gbd7/Gb3>/Gbcc/G1×3b= /G749/G745/G74a/Gd5c/Gb35
/Gbc6/Gcde/Gbc×/Gcd>/Gcda/Gcd7 
/Gbc5/Gd×4/Gcd7,/Gcc3/Gcc>/Gc37/Gcc4/G1×3a/Gc1d,/Gbd7/Gcc3/Gcc>/Gc37/Gcc4/G1×3b,/G73×/Gbcc,/Gbd8/Gbe4/Gbe0/Gbe7_/Gbe0/Gbd4/Gbeb /Gd60,   (1)      
 
where /G73×/Gbcc,/Gbd8/Gbe4/Gbe0/Gbe7_/Gbe0/Gbd4/Gbeb  is the SD’s transmit power limit, and 
/G7×e/Gd×4/Gbd>,/Gbcb/Gbd7/Gb3>/Gbcc/G1×3a/G7ee,/G740/Gbcb/Gbd7/Gb3>/Gbcc/G1×3b is the link loss, between the radar and the 
transmitter, that the transmitter expects.  As disc ussed in 
Section II, there are various ways that an SD can d etermine  
/G7×e/Gd×4/Gbd>,/Gbcb/Gbd7/Gb3>/Gbcc , e.g., when coexistent sharing is employed, /G7×e/Gd×4/Gbd>,/Gbcb/Gbd7/Gb3>/Gbcc  
could be estimated during a start-up phase by avera ging over 
repeated samples of instantaneous link loss between  the radar 
and the SD.  Margin /G7×>/Gbe6 provides interference protection for 
any difference between the instantaneous path loss and the one 
expected by the SD, including differences from sign al fading 
and from any measurement error during the start-up phase.  
When the difference from the expected path loss is high, to 
keep the probability of harmful interference at a p articular 
small level, a higher margin will be needed; this h igher margin 
will result in more conservative extent of secondar y 
transmissions.  Even with an adequate margin, gray space 
sharing inherently introduces some risks that are n ot presented 
with white-space sharing, e.g., the power control m echanisms 
in a secondary system might be hacked and made to i nterfere 
with the primary system, or some system bug might c ause a 
secondary transmitter to inaccurately calculate /G73×/Gbcc,/Gbe0/Gbd4/Gbeb .  To 
mitigate the effects of interference in such cases,  a new 
approach to regulation and governance is required, which is 
beyond the scope of this paper, but discussed in [6 ], [16]. 
From (1), it is possible to calculate SDs’ SINR, /G7e9/Gbcc, which 
will in turn determine achievable data rates.  This  calculation 
is based on the conservative assumption that the ti me between 
radar pulses during which the secondary will not ex perience 
interference from the radar (which is typically les s than 1 ms 
[13]) can be neglected.  When a secondary transmitt er and 
receiver are /G740/Gbcb/Gbd7/Gb3>/Gbcd/Gbd1  and /G740/Gbcb/Gbd7/Gb3>/Gbcb/Gbd1  away from the radar, and the 
secondary transmitter and receiver are /G740/Gbcd/Gbd1/Gb3>/Gbcb/Gbd1  apart, /G7e9/Gbcc is 
 
/G7e9/Gbcc/G1×3a/G7ee,/G740/Gbcb/Gbd7/Gb3>/Gbcd/Gbd1 ,/G740/Gbcb/Gbd7/Gb3>/Gbcb/Gbd1 ,/G740/Gbcd/Gbd1/Gb3>/Gbcb/Gbd1 /G1×3b=/Gbc5/Gcd7,/Gcc4/G1×3a/Gbd7/Gcc5/Gcc9/Gc37/Gcc3/Gcc9 /G1×3b×/Gbc9/Gcc4,/Gcd8/Gccc/Gce3 /G1×3a/Gc1d,/Gbd7/Gcc3/Gcc>/Gc37/Gcc5/Gcc9 /G1×3b
/Gbe1/Gcc4/Gbd0/Gcc4/Gb3e/Gbc5/Gcd7,/Gcc3/Gcc>/Gc37/Gcc4/G1×3a/Gc1d,/Gbd7/Gcc3/Gcc>/Gc37/Gcc3/Gcc9 /G1×3b×/Gbc9/Gcc3/Gcc> 
                                                              (2) 
 
where /G7×e/Gbd>,/Gbcc/G1×3a/G740/Gbcd/Gbd1/Gb3>/Gbcb/Gbd1 /G1×3b is link loss between the secondary 
transmitter-receiver pair, /G74a/Gbcc is background noise power 
spectral density at the secondary receiver, and /G739/Gbcc is a secondary bandwidth per user. 
IV.  PARAMETERS FOR EVALUATING THE EXTENT OF 
SECONDARY TRANSMISSIONS  
The parameters used to evaluate the performance of 
spectrum sharing with radar are: 1) secondary data rate, /G734/Gbd5,/Gbcc,  
calculated from /G7e9/Gbcc; 2) fraction of time that the SD can achieve 
a required data rate /G734/Gbd5,/Gbe5/Gbd8/Gbe4 ; and 3) statistics and distribution of 
time that /G734/Gbd5,/Gbcc< /G734/Gbd5,/Gbe5/Gbd8/Gbe4 , i.e., interrupted time . 
From the SINR in (2), the resulting /G734/Gbd5,/Gbcc/G1×3a/G7e9/Gbcc/G1×3b is calculated 
using a set of equations, obtained from regression analyses on 
3GPP data [17].  The data are obtained assuming 1) an urban 
or suburban environments with fairly small cell and  low delay 
spread (i.e., Extended Pedestrian A channel model);  2) a very 
low speed user (i.e., 5-Hz Doppler frequency); and 3) Multiple 
Input Multiple Output 2×2  in both up- and down-streams.  
The resulting /G734/Gbd5,/Gbcc/G1×3a/G7e9/Gbcc/G1×3b will be the maximum rate obtained 
among QPSK, 16QAM, and 64QAM modulation schemes.  
From (2), /G734/Gbd5,/Gbcc varies periodically, and is a function of 
/G7ee, /G740/Gbcb/Gbd7/Gb3>/Gbcd/Gbd1 , /G740/Gbcb/Gbd7/Gb3>/Gbcb/Gbd1 , and /G740/Gbcd/Gbd1/Gb3>/Gbcb/Gbd1 .  For a given /G734/Gbd5,/Gbe5/Gbd8/Gbe4 , the 
interrupted time together with its statistics, and the fraction of 
time that /G734/Gbd5,/Gbcc≥ /G734/Gbd5,/Gbe5/Gbd8/Gbe4 , /G74c/Gbcb/Gccd,/Gcc4/Gbb9/Gbcb/Gccd,/Gcdd/Gcd0/Gcdc , in a rotating cycle is: 
 
/G74c/Gbcb/Gccd,/Gcc4/Gbb9/Gbcb/Gccd,/Gcdd/Gcd0/Gcdc =/G3c3/G1×4×/Gc1b/Gcc3/Gccd,/Gcc4/Gcb1/Gcc3/Gccd,/Gcdd/Gcd0/Gcdc,/Gcd4/G1×43 ∀/Gcd4
/Gbcd/Gcc3/Gcc>  ,                            (3) 
 
where /G7ec/Gbcb/Gccd,/Gcc4/Gbb9/Gbcb/Gccd,/Gcdd/Gcd0/Gcdc,/Gcd4 is the /G745-th period (in a rotating cycle) that 
/G734/Gbd5,/Gbcc≥ /G734/Gbd5,/Gbe5/Gbd8/Gbe4 , and /G736/Gbcb/Gbd7  is the rotating period.  
Different service classes require different quality  
measurements [11].  For the considered applications , different 
parameters are used to evaluate performance: 1) VoI P requires 
a symmetric constant data rate /G734/Gbd5,/Gbc>/Gbe×/Gbc×/Gbc9  in both up- and 
downstreams, and an interrupted time /G7ec/Gbc>/Gbe×/Gbc×/Gbc9  lower than an 
acceptable level; 2) Video on demand initially requ ires an 
average downstream rate over a rotating cycle /G734/Gbd5,/Gbcc/Gd×4/Gd×4/Gd×4/Gd×4/Gd×4 larger than 
the constant streaming rate /G734/Gbd5,/Gbc>/Gbdc/Gbd7/Gbd8/Gbe× ; as a buffer is used to 
maintain streaming continuity,  the probability tha t the buffer 
will be empty is also evaluated; 3) P2P, file trans fer, web 
browsing, and meter reading, require no minimum dat a rate. , 
For P2P and file transfers, achievable data rate is  an 
appropriate measure.  For an interactive applicatio n like web 
browsing, webpage download time is our measure. 
For VoIP, samples of /G7ec/Gbc>/Gbe×/Gbc×/Gbc9  across a rotating cycle, and its 
distribution, were obtained from instantaneous seco ndary data 
rate and /G734/Gbd5,/Gbc>/Gbe×/Gbc×/Gbc9 .  As VoIP is bi-directional, instantaneous 
secondary data rate for VoIP is the minimum of the up- and 
downstream values. 
For video on demand, given the amount of data neede d for 
initial buffering, /G738/Gbd5/Gbd9_/Gbdc/Gbe1/Gbdc/Gbe7 , the amount of data buffered at time /G750 
after streaming starts (or resumes) /G738/Gbd5/Gbd9 /G1×3a/G750,/G750/Gbe6/Gbe7 /G1×3b is 
 
/G738/Gbd5/Gbd9 /G1×3a/G750,/G750/Gbe6/Gbe7 /G1×3b= /G738/Gbd5/Gbd9_/Gbdc/Gbe1/Gbdc/Gbe7 +/G5ec/G734/Gbd5,/Gbcc,/Gbbd/G1×3a/G750/G11>1/G1×3b/Gbe7
/Gbe7/G11>×/Gb40/Gbe7/Gcde/Gcd> /G740/G750/G11>1−/G734/Gbd5,/Gbc>/Gbdc/Gbd7/Gbd8/Gbe× ,   (4) 
 
where /G734/Gbd5,/Gbcc,/Gbbd/G1×3a/G750/G11>1/G1×3b is the instantaneous downstream secondary IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, Nov. 2012

data rate, and /G750/Gbe6/Gbe7  is the streaming starting time. 
From (4), for a given start time /G750/Gbe6/Gbe7,/Gbdc, one can determine if 
and when the buffer would be empty.  Based on multi ple 
values of /G750/Gbe6/Gbe7,/Gbdc across a rotating cycle, the probability that the 
buffer will be empty, i.e., probability of interrup tions, /G74c/Gbdc/Gbe1/Gbe7/Gbe5/Gbe3 , 
during streaming can be obtained from: 
 
/G74c/Gbdc/Gbe1/Gbe7/Gbe5/Gbe3 =/G3c3/G1×3e/Gbe9/Gcd4/G1×3>/Gcb>/Gcd>/Gcde/Gcd> 
/Gcd4/Gc38/Gc×d
/Gbc7/Gcd>/Gcde/Gcd>  ,                                     (5) 
 
where /G75×/Gbdc is a binary variable that equals 1 if /G738/Gbd5/Gbd9  = 0, and 0 
otherwise.  /G730/Gbe7/Gcde/Gcd>  is the total number of /G750/Gbe6/Gbe7,/Gbdc considered.  Note 
that video on demand operates when /G734/Gbd5,/Gbcc/Gd×4/Gd×4/Gd×4/Gd×4/Gd×4> /G734/Gbd5,/Gbc>/Gbdc/Gbd7/Gbd8/Gbe× , hence, if 
/G738/Gbd5/Gbd9 /Gd6b/G750,/G750/Gbe6/Gbe5/Gbe7,/Gbdc/Gd6> ≠ 0  in a rotating cycle, it will never go to zero 
during streaming.  
For P2P, file transfer, web browsing, and meter rea ding, a 
wide range of file sizes is transferred.  Because s econdary 
transmissions can be interrupted, files of differen t sizes 
experience different perceived data rates /G734/Gbd5,/Gbcc,/Gbe3/G1×3a/G750/Gbe6/Gbe7 /G1×3b, which 
depend on when a file is transferred /G750/Gbe6/Gbe7 .

/Gbcd/Gcd1/G1×3a/Gbe7/Gcde/Gcd> /G1×3b ,                   (6) 
 
where /G738/Gbd9 is size of a file, and /G736/Gbd9/G1×3a/G750/Gbe6/Gbe7 /G1×3b is the time that an SD 
uses to transfer the file, i.e. file transfer time .  Distribution of 
/G734/Gbd5,/Gbcc,/Gbe3 can be obtained by choosing different /G750/Gbe6/Gbe7 ’s. 
V.  NUMERICAL RESULTS  
Parameters used to obtain numerical results are sum marized 
in Section A.  The performance of secondary transmi ssions 
averaged across a cell is evaluated in Section B; t his average 
performance is measured in terms of both mean data rate and 
percentage of time that a secondary device can tran smit.  
Performance for video on demand and VoIP are evalua ted in 
Sections C and D, respectively.  The characteristic s and 
performance of secondary transmissions for file upl oad- and 
downloading services are shown in Section E.  We in vestigate 
sensitivity of these results on important system pa rameters 
including (secondary) cell radius, radar transmit p ower, radar 
tolerable interference level, and radar rotating pe riod in 
Section F.  
A. Scenario 
For the radar we assume: a) operating band at 2.8 G Hz with 
3 MHz bandwidth (ATC radars operate in this band) [ 13]; b) 
30-m high antenna, uniformly-distributed aperture t ype, with 
elevation and azimuthal 3-dB beam widths of 4.7 o and 1.4 o, 
respectively [13], and front-to-back ratio of 38 dB  [12]; c) 
maximum antenna gain of 33.5 dBi [13], with 5 dB re duction 
in the horizontal direction because the antenna is up-tilted to 
reduce ground reflected signals [18]; d) rotating p eriod 
/G736/Gbcb/Gbd7  = 4.7 s; e) transmit power /G73×/Gbcb/Gbd7  = 0.45 MW [13]; f) INR = -
10 dB [14], with -106 dBm background noise [13].   
For the secondary system, we take: a) symmetric TDD ; b) 
MT and BS with omnidirectional antenna with 0 dBi a nd sectorized one with 18 dBi [19], respectively; c) c ell radius (in 
a urban or suburban areas) /G734 = 800 m; d) power limit 
/G73×/Gbcc,/Gbd8/Gbe4/Gbe0/Gbe7_/Gbe0/Gbd4/Gbeb  of the MT and the BS of 23 and 46 dBm, 
respectively [19]; e) background noise spectral den sity at the 
receiver, /G74a/Gbcc = -174 dBm/Hz, with 5 dB noise figure [19]. 
Concerning the applications: the required rate for VoIP 
/G734/Gbd5,/Gbc>/Gbe×/Gbc×/Gbc9  is 15 kbps [11]; video on demand requires streamin g 
rate /G734/Gbd5,/Gbc>/Gbdc/Gbd7/Gbd8/Gbe×  of 1.6 Mbps [20], and will initially buffer conten t 
enough to play for 2 s [21].   
The ITU-R P.1546 path loss model [22] between the r adar 
and the secondary system is adopted.  The path loss  model is 
valid in the frequency range [0.03, 3] GHz, and dis tances in 
[1, 1 000] km.  Conservatively, flat terrain is ass umed; even 
though the assumption would result in longer distan ces that 
the radar and the secondary can affect each other, it will 
increase interference between the radar and the sec ondary 
system, and reduce the extent of secondary transmis sions.  For 
the path loss between a BS and MT, the COST 231 Wal fisch-
Ikegami model [23] is adopted as follows: a) 1.7-m high MT 
antenna; b) building height of 15 m; c) 30-m high B S antenna, 
implying that the cell radius can be up to 1.5 km [ 19].    In the 
US, a nationwide mean height of a commercial cellul ar tower 
is around 60 m (the tower portfolio is from a major  US tower 
company, American Towers [24, Table 1]), hence, 30 m 
represents a reasonable compromise between an on-to wer 
antenna and a rooftop one; d) other required parame ters as 
suggested in [23].   
Rayleigh fading is assumed in the link between the radar 
and the MT; as the difference between the height of  radar and 
that of the MT is typically large, Line of Sight (L oS) between 
both rarely exists.  The corresponding margin /G7×>/Gbe6, in (1), of 
8.4 dB is used.  The margin results in a probabilit y of harmful 
interference less than 0.1% [25], which is less tha n radar’s 
required misdetection probability of around 1% [26] .  For the 
link between the radar and the BS, Ricean fading (w ith a K 
factor of 10 dB, the corresponding margin resulting  in a 
probability of harmful interference less than 0.1% is around 5 
dB [25]) is assumed when their separation is less t han an LoS 
distance, and Rayleigh one is assumed otherwise. (W ith the 
considered heights of radar and BS, the LoS distanc e is around 
20.8 km, [27, Chapter 2].)  The difference between 
instantaneous link loss, and the value expected by a secondary 
transmitter /G7×e/Gd×4/Gbd>,/Gbcb/Gbd7/Gb3>/Gbcc , as shown in (1), that is due to 
measurement error, is assumed to be negligible comp ared to 
the difference due to fading.  
To evaluate a typical extent of secondary transmiss ions 
achievable in a cell, data rate and percentage of t ime that a 
secondary device can transmit, averaged across a ce ll, need to 
be considered.  Hence, the case when the location o f the 
secondary user is uniformly located across the cell  is 
considered.  In contrast, to evaluate the performan ce of 
sharing for a given application, the location of a secondary 
user needs to be specified, and the worst case is c onsidered 
when the user is fixed at the cell edge in the wors t direction, 
which is toward the radar. 
For sensitivity analysis, the ranges of parameters considered IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, Nov. 2012

are: a) cell radius /G734 in [0.2, 1.5] km [19]; b) radar transmit 
power /G73×/Gbcb/Gbd7  in [0.025, 1.4] MW [13]; c) radar INR in [-13, -
7] dB, adapted from [14]; d) radar rotating period /G736/Gbcb/Gbd7  in 
[4, 6] s [13]. 
B. Overall Performance of Secondary Transmissions  
Fig. 2 shows the mean secondary data rate over a ro tating 
cycle, and the fraction of time that an SD can tran smit, as a 
function of the distance between the BS and the rad ar.  The 
data rate and the fraction of transmission time are  averaged 
across the cell.   
Fig. 2 shows that spectrum shared with a radar can support 
high average data rates, even when an SD is close t o the radar.  
Consider the conventional non-opportunistic approac h.  The 
distance between the BS and the radar that allows t he SD to 
transmit all the time at the data rate achieved in dedicated 
spectrum, i.e., system rate limit , is around 400 km (the 
required separation is around 100 km for downstream , and 
400 km for upstream). Alternatively, if only the ra dar is to be 
protected [9], with a 8.4 dB fade margin, the minim um 
separation is 286 km.  In contrast, by taking advan tage of main 
beam rotation, significant downstream transmissions  are 
possible at a fraction of this 400 km distance.  At  50 km from 
the radar (i.e., just 12.5% of 400 km), in the down stream the 
SD can transmit almost all the time with an average  rate near 
the system limit of 10.8 Mbps.  In the upstream, at  19% of 
400 km, the SD can transmit 90% of the time, with a n average 
rate around 62.5% of the 8.0 Mbps limit.

Station and a Radar. 
 
Fig. 2 also shows that the secondary system uses sp ectrum 
more efficiently in the downstream than in the upst ream, in 
terms of data rate per MHz of spectrum, and fractio n of time 
that the system can transmit.  If the goal is to ma ximize 
spectral efficiency, spectrum sharing with radar mi ght be more 
suitable for applications that have more traffic in  the 
downstream, which is a typical characteristic of ma ny current 
applications.  
C. Performance of Video on Demand 
One important measure of performance for video on 
demand is average downstream data rate.  In the pre vious 
section, we showed that even at small distance from  the radar, 
the achievable average downstream rate is very clos e to the 
rate one might get in dedicated spectrum. 
Another performance measurement is the probability that 
streaming will be interrupted.  It is found that th is probability 
is sufficiently low, being unlikely to be a problem .  Even when 
the average downstream rate /G734/Gbd5,/Gbcc/Gd×4/Gd×4/Gd×4/Gd×4/Gd×4 is only 4% higher than the 
streaming rate, and the BS is 9.6 km from the radar , with the 
initial buffering of 2 s the possibility of interru ption is less 
than 0.001.   (The hypothesis testing on this proba bility used 
10,000 samples; the resulting p-value is 0.0008; th e result is 
obtained when the MT is at the cell edge closest to  the radar.)  
From the assumption on the initial buffering, the a mount of 
content the application needs to initially buffer f or 1.6 Mbps 
streaming rate is 400 kB.  With only 3 MHz of spect rum, the 
transfer time for the initial-buffer content is at most 3 s even at 
only 9.6 km from the radar.  Graphs are omitted for  brevity. 
Due to the high achievable average downstream data rate, 
and the small chance of being interrupted (even wit h only a 
few seconds of initial buffering, and when the seco ndary is 
very close to the radar), video on demand is a very  promising 
application for spectrum that is shared with radar.  
D. Performance of Voice over IP 
One important requirement for VoIP is a symmetric d ata 
rate in both up- and downstreams.  Hence, the asymm etric 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 0246810 12

data rate, as shown in Fig. 2(a), will limit perfor mance of 
VoIP.  Moreover, VoIP performance depends on instan taneous 
data rate, and the application cannot tolerate long  
interruptions.  In shared spectrum, interruptions s ometimes 
cause the instantaneous secondary data rate to be m uch lower 
than the average one, and could be a problem for Vo IP.  
With a required instantaneous rate of 15 kbps, Fig.  3 shows 
the probability that the resulting interrupted time  /G7ec/Gbc>/Gbe×/Gbc×/Gbc9  would 
be less than an acceptable level /G7ec/Gbc>/Gbe×/Gbc×/Gbc9_/Gbd4 (when the user is at the 
cell edge), as a function of distance of secondary 
transmissions from a radar; /G7ec/Gbc>/Gbe×/Gbc×/Gbc9_/Gbd4  is taken as 80 and 150 ms 
[11].  Fig. 3 shows that /G7ec/Gbc>/Gbe×/Gbc×/Gbc9_/Gbd4  is always satisfied beyond 
70 km from the radar.  Note from Fig. 2(a) that, at  this 
distance, the average upstream rate is around 5 Mbp s; 
however, the application can only obtain at least 1 5 kbps 
instantaneous data rate with the acceptable interru pted time.  
Compared to VoIP operating in dedicated spectrum, V oIP is 
relatively inefficient in spectrum shared with rada r, and hence 
is not attractive for such sharing.  
E. Performance of File Up- and Downloading 
As occurs with VoIP, the fluctuations in data rate can also 
affect performance of file up- and downloading serv ices.  Files 
with different sizes would experience different ran ges of 
perceived data rate, defined in Section IV.  The fl uctuation 
and its implications on applications in this servic e class are 
investigated, in Sections E-1 and E-2, respectively . 
 
Figure 3 - Possibility that a VoIP Interrupted Time is less an Acceptable Level 
vs. Distance between a Base Station and a Radar. 
  
E-1 Fluctuations in Secondary Perceived Data Rate 
Fig. 4 shows maximum, mean and minimum perceived 
downstream data rate of a user at the cell edge as a function of 
file size.  The results from the upstream show a si milar trend, 
and thus are omitted.   
Figure 4 - Perceived Secondary Downstream Data Rate vs. Size of a File. 
 
Fig. 4 shows that a small file would experience a w ider 
range of perceived data rate than a large one, beca use a small 
file is more likely to be transferred in less than a rotating 
period.  Due to sporadic interruptions in transmiss ions, file 
transfer time, and hence, perceived data rate, woul d highly 
depend on when the transfer starts.  In contrast, t he 
fluctuations are unnoticeable and appear the same a s if this 
were dedicated spectrum when the file size is above  a certain 
threshold that makes file transfer time much longer  than the 
rotating period; this threshold is much smaller for  SDs that are 
closer to the radar.  From Fig. 4, at 4 km from the  radar, the 
fluctuation in perceived data rate tends to be insi gnificant for 
any file larger than 100 kB, while at 10 km, the fl uctuation 
starts to be insignificant for a file larger than 1  MB. 
Thus, fluctuations in perceived data rate depend on  file size, 
and distance between an SD and the radar.  As long as radar 
transmissions still affect secondary transmissions,  these 
fluctuations will be most noticeable when an SD far  from the 
radar transfers a small file.  The fluctuations cou ld be a 
problem for some applications, but not all.  
 
E-2 Implications of the Fluctuations for Various Ap plications 
We start with P2P and transfers of a large file (e. g., a song 
which is typically much larger than 1 MB), for whic h the 
perceived data rate is the typical measure of perfo rmance.  
P2P is often used for transfers of large files, and  transfers that 
do not have strict delay requirements.  Because fil e size is 
large, interruptions in secondary transmissions wou ld have 
little impact on perceived secondary data rate, as shown in 
Fig. 4.  Moreover, Fig. 2(a) shows that the SD coul d achieve a 
high average data rate even close to the radar, hen ce, P2P and 
transfers of large files could also be promising fo r spectrum 
sharing, although it might not be quite as promisin g as video 
on demand, of which traffic is mostly in the downst ream. 
Guaranteeing high data rates for small files is mor e 
challenging.  Fig. 5 shows the 1st-percentile and m ean 
perceived downstream rate (of a user at the cell ed ge) as a 
function of distance of a BS from the radar. Fig. 5  shows that 
transferring files with different sizes would exper ience 
approximately the same mean perceived rate at any d istance 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 00.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1

from the radar.  However, for small files (i.e., sm aller than 
1 MB), the 1st-percentile perceived rate can be muc h lower 
than the mean, hence, for transfers of small files,  this could be 
a problem, if users would not tolerate fluctuations  in perceived 
data rate.  Thus, such applications would not be su itable for 
sharing spectrum with radar. Upstream results are s imilar, but 
are omitted.   
 
Figure 5 - First Percentile, and Mean Perceived Dow nstream Data Rate vs. 
Distance between a Base Station and a Radar. 
 
There are also applications for which file transfer  time, 
rather than perceived data rate, is the important p erformance 
measure.  Although transferring small files, the ap plications 
would still work well in spectrum shared with radar .  One 
example is web browsing, since users probably expec t a web 
page to be retrieved just as quickly, even if it co ntains many 
more bytes.  Time for downloading a web page is sug gested to 
be less than 2 to 4 s (with a preferred target of 0 .5 s) [11]. 
Fig. 5 shows that just beyond 10% of the 286 km dis tance at 
which secondary transmissions will not affect the r adar, a user 
downloading a 1 MB web page would experience the 1s t-
percentile perceived rate of around 8 Mbps.  The 90 th-
percentile webpage size in 2010 was 660 kB [28], he nce, even 
with 3 MHz of spectrum, 99% of the time, more than 90% of 
transfers would experience file transfer time less than 1 s.  For 
the web pages larger than 1 MB, the file transfer t ime would 
be less than 1 s; however, this transfer time is no t very 
different from the one when transmissions occur in dedicated 
spectrum.  For example, with the 10.8 Mbps downstre am rate 
limit, the transfer time for a web page larger than  1 MB would 
be larger than 740 ms.  Thus, quality of service is  good for 
web browsing even close to the radar. 
There are also applications that transfer small fil es, but can 
tolerate interruptions during transmissions, e.g., automatic 
meter reading.  Generally, the system consists of m any meters 
installed at users’ premises; each of these devices  
intermittently transfers a small amount of informat ion, in the 
order of tens of kB, to an aggregation point.  Beca use 
significant delays are tolerable, an average amount  of data that 
can be transferred in a given period is the importa nt 
performance measure.  As Fig. 2(a) shows that the s econdary 
system can achieve high average data rate, spectrum  shared with radar would also work well with this applicati on.  
F. Sensitivity Analysis 
In this section, we evaluate the sensitivity of the  average 
extent of secondary transmissions, and fluctuations  in 
perceived secondary data rate on four important par ameters: 
secondary cell radius, /G734; radar transmit power, /G73×/Gbcb/Gbd7 ; radar 
tolerable interference level, i.e., maximum INR); r adar 
rotating period, /G736/Gbcb/Gbd7 . 
 
F-1 Sensitivity of Average Extent of Secondary Tran smissions 
Unlike the other parameters considered, changing ra dar 
rotating period will not change the amount of data an SD can 
transfer in a given period of time, and thus, it wi ll have no 
impact on the average extent of secondary transmiss ions.  
Hence, we will omit these graphical results.  The a verage 
extent of secondary transmission is calculated acro ss a cell. 
Fig. 6 shows the average secondary data rate, and t he 
percentage of time that an SD can transmit for both  up- and 
downstream, as a function of the cell radius.  Fig.  6 shows 
that, as expected, the average data rate and percen tage of time 
that a secondary device can transmit at a given dis tance from 
the radar decreases with increasing cell radius.  I t is still the 
case that extensive communications are possible for  a cell that 
is relatively close to the radar, but for larger ce lls, the cell 
must be somewhat farther from the radar.  
Fig. 6(a) shows that in the upstream, at 70 km from  the 
radar, the average data rate of a cell with 0.8 km radius is 
around 60% of the system rate limit, as defined in Section V-
B; 70 km is around 24% of the 286 km distance.  For  a larger 
cell, with 1.5 km radius, the same level of upstrea m data rate 
can be achieved at around 100 km from the radar (35 % of 
286 km).  Moreover, in the downstream, at only 14% of the 
286 km distance, a cell with 1.5 km radius can achi eve almost 
100% of the system rate limit.  Hence, the secondar y system 
can still achieve high data rates close to the rada r, even with a 
fairly large cell.

(b) Percentage of Time that a Secondary Device can T ransmit 
Figure 6 - Sensitivity of Extent of Transmissions on  Cell Radius. 
 
Fig. 7 shows the average data rate as a function of  radar 
transmit power.  Changes in radar transmit power ha ve a 
similar effect on both data rate and the percentage  of time that 
an SD can transmit, similar to what we observed wit h changes 
in cell radius in Fig. 6. Hence, results showing th e percentage 
of time that an SD can transmit are omitted for bre vity.  
Fig. 7 shows that the data rate decreases with incr easing 
transmit power of the radar.  However, high average  data rates 
close to a radar can still be attained, even when t he radar 
transmit power is high, if the cell is a bit farthe r from the 
radar.  For example, in the upstream when the radar  transmit 
power increases from 0.5 to 1.4  MW, the distance f rom a cell 
to the radar needs to be increased from around 70 t o 90 km, so 
that the achievable data rate is still around 60% o f the system 
rate limit (90 km is still only 31% of 286 km).  In  the 
downstream, the increase in radar transmit power on ly slightly 
decreases the average data rate, hence, the seconda ry system 
can achieve high data rates at fairly short distanc e to a radar 
transmitting with high power. 
 
Figure 7 - Sensitivity of Average Data Rate on Rada r Transmit Power. 
 
Fig. 8 shows the averaged data rate as a function o f the 
radar’s tolerable INR.  As expected, the data rate slightly decreases with a more stringent requirement on rada r tolerable 
interference level, i.e., smaller tolerable INR.  F or example, in 
the downstream at 20 km from the radar, reducing IN R from -
10 to -13 dB would decrease the average data rate f rom 93% 
to 88% of the rate limit.  Note from Fig. 8 that we  see no 
impact of INR on the average upstream data rate, be cause an 
SD can transmit with power higher than its equipmen t limit 
without causing harmful interference to a radar.  H ence, an SD 
will still transmit at its equipment power limit ev en when the 
radar tolerable interference level changes; this is  more likely 
to happen when there are only a few MTs in a cell, as assumed 
in this scenario.  However, when there are many use rs, we 
expect that reducing radar’s INR would decrease the  data rate 
in both up- and downstreams.   
 
Figure 8 - Sensitivity of Average Data Rate on Rada r Tolerable Interference 
Level. 
 
Similarly to Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, the secondary syste m can still 
achieve high data rates under more stringent INRs w hen a cell 
is a bit farther from the radar, e.g., by moving a cell from 20 to 
only 30 km from the radar, the downstream data rate , for 
INR = -13 dB, is 96% of the rate limit.  Thus, the secondary 
system can also achieve high data rates close to th e radar even 
under radar’s stringent tolerable interference requ irements. 
In addition, for a typical range of cell radius, tr ansmit power 
and tolerable interference level of the radar, comp aring Fig. 6, 
Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 shows that cell radius would rela tively have 
higher impact on the extent of secondary transmissi ons 
compared to the other parameters.  For example, at 20 km 
from the radar, in the downstream, the average data  rate 
increases from 70% to 99% of the rate limit, when c ell radius 
decreases from 1.5 to 0.2 km.  At the same distance  from the 
radar, the average downstream data rate increases f rom 88% to 
96% of the rate limit, when INR increases from -13 to -7 dB, 
while the average downstream data rate slightly inc reases 
from 93% to 94% of the rate limit, when the radar t ransmit 
power decreases from 1.4 to 0.025 MW.  Hence, at le ast for an 
ATC radar, if one adjusts design parameters within a range 
that might be considered reasonable, the extent of secondary 
transmissions achievable seems to be affected more by the 
radius of the cell rather than by the transmit powe r and 
tolerable interference of the radar that the second ary system 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 40 50 60 70 80 90 100

F-2 Sensitivity of Fluctuations in Perceived Second ary Data 
Rate 
Fig. 9 shows fluctuations in perceived data rate as  a 
function of file size: in the upstream at 70 km fro m the radar, 
and in the downstream at 20 km.  The fluctuations i n 
perceived data rate are evaluated for a user at the  edge of a cell 
in the direction toward the radar.  It is seen, fro m Section V-E, 
that when radar transmissions still affect transmis sions of the 
secondary system, the farther away from the radar, the higher 
fluctuations in perceived data a secondary user wou ld 
experience.  At 70 km from the radar for upstream a nd at 
20 km for downstream, secondary transmissions are s till 
highly affected by the radar; Fig. 2 shows that the  increasing 
rate (i.e., slope) of the extent of secondary trans missions with 
distance from the cell to the radar starts to decre ase after 
around 70 and 20 km for up- and downstreams, respec tively. 
Fig. 9(a) shows that, as expected, a user in a smal ler cell 
would experience higher fluctuations in perceived d ata rate 
than that in a larger cell.  However, the increase in fluctuations 
in perceived data rate with decreasing cell radius will not be a 
problem, as a user uploading large files (i.e., lar ger than 
1 MB) would still experience insignificant fluctuat ions even 
when the cell radius is as small as 200 m.  For the  
downstream, Fig. 9(b) shows that at only 20 km from  the 
radar, a user downloading large files would also ex perience 
insignificant fluctuations in perceived data rate e ven when the 
cell radius is 200 m.  Hence, a user transferring a  large file 
would still experience insignificant fluctuations i n perceived 
data rate even in a small cell.

Radius. 
 
The effect of the other parameters (including trans mit 
power, INR, and rotating period) on the fluctuation s in 
downstream perceived data rate are similar to the e ffect of cell 
radius as shown in Fig. 9(b), hence, the results on  fluctuations 
of perceived data rate in the downstream are omitte d.  For the 
upstream, Fig. 10 shows the perceived data rate as a function 
of file size when (a) the radar transmit powers are  0.025, 0.45, 
and 1.4 MW, (b) INR is -13, -10, and -7 dB, and (c)  the 
rotating periods are 4, 4.7, and 6 s; the results a re from a cell 
70 km away from the radar.  Fig. 10 shows that chan ges in 
these three parameters have only marginal impact on  the 
fluctuations in data rate perceived when files larg er than 1 MB 
are uploaded.  Hence, when one adjusts these parame ters 
within this reasonable range, a user transferring a  large file 
would still experience insignificant fluctuations i n perceived 
data rate.  Note from Fig. 10(b) that, as we can ex pect from 
the sensitivity analysis on average extent of secon dary 
transmissions, when a small number of users are ass umed in a

VI.  CONCLUSIONS  
We study opportunistic primary-secondary spectrum 
sharing with a rotating radar.  A secondary device is allowed 
to transmit as long as the resulting interference d oes not 
exceed the tolerable level of the radar.  The secon dary system 
considered provides communications in non-contiguou s cells 
around the radar. 
This paper considers sharing between a radar and a cell, as 
might be appropriate if the secondary system provid es 
broadband hotspots, or is a cellular system utilizi ng the shared 
spectrum when traffic temporarily exceeds the capac ity of its 
dedicated spectrum.  The model will be extended to multiple 
cells and radars in future work.  Unlike existing m odels of 
sharing with radar, the proposed model allows secon dary 
devices to adjust to variations in radar antenna ga in as the 
radar’s main beam rotates, thereby making extensive  
secondary transmissions possible, although with som e 
interruptions and fluctuations.  Thus, sharing spec trum with 
rotating radar is a promising option to alleviate s pectrum 
scarcity.  Additional technical and governance mech anisms 
are needed, e.g. to address interference from malfu nctioning devices [6], [16]. 
It is also found that the secondary system will uti lize 
spectrum more efficiently in the downstream than in  the 
upstream, where efficiency may be measured in data rate per 
MHz of spectrum as compared to what can be achieved  in 
dedicated spectrum, and fraction of time that a sec ondary 
device can transmit.  Hence, spectrum sharing with radar 
would be more appropriate for applications that req uire more 
capacity in the downstream, which is a typical char acteristic of 
many applications.  However, if needed, the upstrea m rate 
could be increased by dedicating more spectrum to t he 
upstream. 
Moreover, with the dynamic sharing model considered , the 
secondary system can achieve extensive transmission s in large 
areas that otherwise would be unavailable with curr ent 
approaches to sharing with radar which is more stat ic.  For 
example, with the base-case assumptions, a secondar y device 
that does not adjust its transmit power as the rada r’s main 
beam rotates must be at least 286 km from the radar  to prevent 
harmful interference.  With the sharing model, at 2 7% of the 
distance at which secondary transmissions will not affect a 
radar, the secondary system can transmit all the ti me in the 
downstream with an average data rate almost equal t o that 
achieved in dedicated spectrum, and roughly 90% of the time 
in the upstream with an average rate equal to 63% o f the 
dedicated-spectrum data rate.  It is also find that  the secondary 
system can still achieve extensive transmissions ev en when 
key system parameters, including cell radius, radar  transmit 
power, radar tolerable interference level and radar  rotating 
period, change from the base-case assumptions.  
Although average data rate is roughly the same for all file 
sizes, because of interruptions as the radar rotate s, perceived 
data rate fluctuates for smaller files while appear ing fairly 
constant for larger files.  The magnitude of this f luctuation is 
also more noticeable when a secondary device far fr om the 
radar transmits small files.  The fluctuations in p erceived data 
rate make sharing spectrum with radar attractive fo r 
applications that can tolerate interruptions in tra nsmissions, 
such as video on demand, peer-to-peer file sharing,  and 
automatic meter reading, or applications that trans fer large 
enough files so the fluctuations are not noticeable , such as 
song transfers.  Moreover, even with changes in cel l radius, 
radar transmit power, radar tolerable interference level, and 
radar rotating period, spectrum shared with radar i s still 
attractive to these applications.  
Especially for video on demand, because currently t he 
application is the fastest rising traffic class in the Internet [29], 
it appears to be a very promising application that can share 
spectrum with radar.  We have also found that this form of 
sharing works well with an application such as web browsing 
for which file transfer time rather than perceived data rate is 
the most appropriate performance measure.  In contr ast, 
spectrum shared with radar would be unattractive fo r 
interactive exchanges of small pieces of data, e.g. , packets or 
files, of which instantaneous data rate matters, su ch as VoIP. 10 -3 10 -2 10 -1 10 010 110 -2 10 -1 10 010 1
