ABSTRACT  
 
The continuous rise in the adoption of emerging technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) by 
businesses has brought unprecedented opportunities for innovation and growth. However, due 
to the distinct characteristics of these emerging  IoT technologies  like real-time data processing, 
Self-configuration, interoperability,  and scalability , they have also introduced some unique 
cybersecurity challenges, such as malware attacks, advanced persistent threats (APTs), DoS 
/DDoS (Denial of Service & Distributed Denial of Service attacks) and insider threats. As a 
result of these challenges, there is an increased need for improved cybersecurity approaches 
and efficient management solutions to ensure the privacy  and security of communication within 
IoT networks. One proposed security approach is the utilization of trust -based systems  and is 
the focus of this study . This research paper presents a systematic literature review on the Trust -
based cybersecurity security approaches for IoT. A total of 23 artic les were identified that 
satisfy  the review  criteria. We highlighted the common trust -based mitigation techniques in 
existence for dealing with these threats and grouped them into three major categories, namely: 
Observation -Based, Knowledge -Based & Cluster -Based systems. Finally, several open issues 
were highlighted, and future research directions presented.

1. INTRODUCTION  
 
In recent years, the rapid rise in the  adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has 
revolutionized the way businesses operate, establishing new avenues for innovation and growth. 
The phrase "Internet of Things" was first coined by Kevin Ashton, linking the idea of Radio 
Frequency Identi fication (RFID) tags to supply chain management in 1999  [1]. Ever since then, 
there has been an exceptional  level of IoT proliferation with several different applications of the 
technology a cross multiple industries including Retail  [2] Construction  [3], Financial Services  
[4], Agriculture  [5] and Healthcare  [6]. 
 
Internet of Things technology has consistent ly been  deployed in various forms across multiple 
industries, such as Smart manufacturing, Smart Power Grid Systems, Smart Cities, Smart Supply 
Chains etc. resulting in several organizations being able to automate processes, and boost 
productivity. The tot al number total of IoT connected devices was estimated to be around 15 
billion as of 2020 and is expected to be doubled by the year 2030 [7]. However, the adoption of 26                                       Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT)  
these IoT tech nologies has also introduced several unique cybersecurity challenges that cannot be 
ignored  [8]. 
The ubiquitous nature of IoT devices and their various deployments tend to attract maliciou s 
attackers seeking to exploit networks vulnerabilities and to gain unauthorized access to sensitive 
data and information. This has resulted in an increase in the spate of cyberattacks, ranging from 
Brute force attacks, Social Engineering attacks, Man in t he Middle attacks, Denial of Service 
(DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, etc. These attacks not only cause 
substantial damages to processes and productivity for businesses but have resulted in several 
privacy and confidentiality concern s [9]. 
 
To address these security challenges, it is essential  to understand the evolving threats and 
vulnerabilities associated with IoT technology in terms of confidentiality, integrity , and 
availability. An enhanced security approach and management solution which offers more secure 
and reliable network communications is therefore required because such distributed systems often 
have flexible topologies and have decentralized controls. On e such proposed security approach is 
by means of Trust -based systems  [10]. A trust -based system in one which identifies, collates, and 
makes security decisions based on trust values, and reputation  [11]. Specifically, in relation to the 
application of Trust -based systems to the problem of cyber security in IoT networks, to the best 
of our knowledge there appears to be ver y limited Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs).  
 
In the study  by Tyagi et al . [12] the challenges and problems associated with the use of trust 
management systems for security and privacy in  IoT were highlighted . An analysis of trust 
evaluation and management techniques was done, and these techniques were classified  under four 
major areas:  computational , cryptography, and probabilistic, information theory -based and others.  
There have been som e other studies on cyber security techniques for IoT technologies and its 
broader impact in relation to cyber risk management frameworks. Several review articles  [13]-
[15] on this have been published. Studies [16]-[20] have reviewed methods for detecting 
cyberattacks and mitigation of attacks on IoT devices and sen sor networks using machine 
learning and deep learning.  
 
This research paper aims to contribute to this understanding by conducting a systematic literature 
review on the cybersecurity challenges specific to IoT technology and its various applications of 
Trust-based systems. By analysing existing studies and research, the review seeks to identify the 
common types of threats targeting IoT technologies and the corresponding trust -based mitigation 
techniques employed to counteract them [21]. 
 
The contributions of this paper are as follows:  
 
 A systematic literature review (SLR) on the state of the art in literature of trust -based 
approaches as applied to cybersecurity of IoT.  
 
 A detailed analysis of  trust-based systems and techniques are presented in this paper. 
Also, based on the reviewed literature, these techniques are grouped into three major 
categories, namely: Observation -Based, Knowledge -Based & Cluster -Based systems. 
The challenges associated  with each of these techniques are also highlighted in this 
paper.  
 
 A review of the design approaches, key performance metrics for evaluating the efficiency 
and accuracy of trust -based systems, as well as the advantages, and disadvantages of 
trust-based cy bersecurity techniques.  
 Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT)                                      27 
 Identification of several open issues and challenges for research on trust and reputation in 
IoT. 
2. RELATED WORK 
 
Cybersecurity of IoT networks continues to be an interesting area for research and development. 
As IoT technology evolv es, new threats and vulnerabilities continue to emerge. Several reviews 
have proposed methods to deal with the security challenges common with IoT networks. The 
approaches deployed vary and authors have focused on different aspects on the security IoT 
netw orks by using a systematic review approach. However, the focus of this research work is to 
review the use of trust -based systems as a means of securing IoT networks. Trust -based 
management techniques employ a systematic method for effectively managing and ensuring trust 
within a network  [11]. This process usually involves the identification and removal of 
untrustworthy entities, such as malicious nodes, attacking nodes, malfunctioning node s, and 
selfish nodes from the network [22]. A comprehensive summary of the various recent surveys 
concerning trust -based approaches for IoT security is shown in Table 1 below.  
 
Tan and Azman  [23] presented a study of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) security 
architecture and analysed the gap between security requirements of IIoT technologies and their 
deployed industry c ountermeasures. The IIoT concept was grouped into a four -layer security 
architecture based on a defined IIoT CIA+ model. However, in the study, the authors failed to 
discuss the potential impact of deploying emerging technologies as a means of ensuring the  
security of IIoT networks.  In a study by Kaur et al. [24] attacks, datasets, as well as machine 
learning algorithms and structures employed in the context of intrusion detection systems f or IoT 
devices were highlighted. A categorisation of attacks targeting IoT devices across various layers 
and protocols was done. The authors further identified prospective features that can be harnessed 
by machine learning -based intrusion detection systems  to effectively identify diverse attack 
types. However, there were no specific examples of the results of the identified attacks to add 
depth and contextualize the outlined efforts and classifications.  
 
Din et al. [25] examined key IoT trust management strategies, emphasizing their advantages and 
disadvantages while providing descriptions of each approach. However, although the review 
primarily was centred on IoT, there was a lack of presentat ion of a classification system, 
including paper selection criteria and publication year considerations. A study by Shirvani and 
Masdari [26] focused on exploring trust security in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT) and 
addressing the challenges associated with managing trust within IoT systems. A comparative 
analysis of these trust -based schemes was presented incorporating concepts and evaluation 
metrics drawn from the e xisting literature. However, the authors did not present any classification 
and open issues, did not conduct the review systematically and did not describe how the papers 
were selected or what publication years were considered.  
 
Muzammal et al. [10] investigated the security challenges associated with IoT networks and the 
Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). The authors also, explored different 
approaches for mitigating  threats and the importance of trust within IoT. However, the review 
was not conducted systematically, also, the paper selection processes, and the covered years of 
the selected papers were not indicated.  In the study  by Lee,  [13] an examination was conducted 
on IoT cybersecurity technologies and cyber risk management frameworks. Subsequently, a 
comprehensive four -layer IoT cyber risk management framework was introduced. Additionally, 
the paper dem onstrated the practical application of a linear programming approach for 
distributing financial resources among multiple IoT cybersecurity projects, offering a proof of 
concept through an illustrative example. However, the paper selection process, evaluati on 
parameters, applied tools, and open issues were not explored. Also, it was not a systematic 28                                       Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT)  
literature review.  Abdullah et al. [27] reviewed the cybersecurity landscape within the IoT 
domain, highlighting its security challenges. It also addressed specific security requirements and 
techniques to mitigate the identified challenges. The authors also explored the potential of 
blockchain technology as a recommended solution to bolster IoT s ecurity. However, the authors 
neither conducted the review systematically nor defined the process of paper selection as well 
publication years of reviewed papers.

Ahmad et al.  [28] conducted a survey of the enabling cloud -based IoT architecture  and classified  
the cloud security concerns in IoT into four major categories, namely Data, Network and Service, 
Applications, and People -related security issues.  However, the review was primarily focused on 
cloud network enviro nments.  Shah and Sengupta [29] surveyed the various categories of 
cyberattacks and cyber security vulnerabilities of IoT and IIoT devices.  However, the paper failed 
to present any future resear ch directions or elaborate of research methodology used.  
 
An evaluation of emerging IIoT paradigm was done by Tyagi et al. [12] by identifying specific 
domains of IIoT adoption, assessing th reats and vulnerabilities, and carried out a detailed analysis 
of existing countermeasures. The authors also highlighted the benefits and challenges of IIoT 
adoption in industrial sectors with emphasis on the distinctive peculiarities of IIoT deployments. 
However, most of the security countermeasures presented are designed primarily for consumer 
IoT and fail to address the highlighted security concerns.  A study by Anwar et al.  [41] assess ed 
the design and development of trust -based security for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The 
results were analysed, with a focus on the designs, applications, and protocols, as well as trust 
factors. The study suggested that designing the trust managemen t models based on the taxonomy Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT)                                      29 
of routing applications and relevant algorithms require further investigations. The study provides 
a significant contribution to Hybrid and scalable security solutions for trustworthy and secure  
 
routing environment for WSNs . However, the scope was very narrow and was focused solely on 
WSNs.  
 
3. METHODOLOGY  
 
A systematic literature review process, based on Barbara Kitchenham's method [43], was carried 
out wi th the aim of surveying the existing knowledge about the topic of this article. The SLR 
methodology employed in this study is depicted in Figure 1. Initially, we meticulously formulated 
a comprehensive review plan. Subsequently, we identified the research' s imperative, established 
the search and review protocols, and conducted exhaustive searches across various databases as 
stipulated in the review plan. Following this, we eliminated duplicate articles from the search 
results and conducted a preliminary rev iew of the remaining articles, resulting in a curated list of 
potentially valuable articles. These selected articles underwent thorough scrutiny and analysis, 
culminating in the compilation of a list comprising pertinent articles for this research. Detaile d 
information about the review planning can be found in Section 3, while the outcomes of the 
search and review process are presented in Section 4 .

3.2. Research Gaps  identified  
 
To conduct the literature review, various databases were scrutinized to identify relevant studies 
published between 2010 and 2023. The selection criteria included papers addressing 
cybersecurity aspects of IoT, threat analysis, risk assessment , and mitigation strategies. A total of 
23 research papers were selected and thoroughly analysed to extract key findings and insights.  
The analysis of the literature revealed several significant trends and research gaps in the area of 
trust-based cybersecu rity approaches for IoT. The identified trends encompassed authentication 
mechanisms, encryption techniques, anomaly detection, and intrusion detection systems specific 
to IoT networks and devices. Moreover, the study uncovered research gaps related to the  lack of 
standardized security frameworks, limited real -world case studies, and the need for more 
comprehensive threat intelligence and sharing platforms.

To make the work more focused, the following questions were put forward to guide the 
investigation:  
 
 RQ1 - What is the state of the art of Trust -based systems in addressing cybersecurity 
needs in IoT environments?  
 
 RQ2 - Which metrics are essential for evaluating and calculating Trust within IoT 
networks?  
 
 RQ3 - What are the open issues and future challe nges of Trust -based systems in the IoT?  
 
The specification of the need for this research, along with the delineation of the search and 
review protocols employed for the Systematic Literature Review, is outlined as follows . 
 
3.3. Resources for Literature Review  
 
The following academic databases were used for this literature review:  
SCOPUS, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, Springer. Google Scholar was used as an initial source 
for general reading material . 
 
3.4. Search Protocol  
 
This explains the search protocol applied to the databases. Consequently, the specific keywords 
(K) utilized for the review, as well as their Combinations (C), have been specified (refer to Table 
2). Several general guidelines were established for executing searches across each of the 
designated reso urces, including:  
 
 In certain instances, the search terms were input in a stepwise manner, refining the results 
of preceding searches.  
 
 In cases where search results were restricted in accessibility, alternative avenues, such as 
authors' personal websites,  were explored to locate the documents.  
 
 Consideration was given to the possibility of encountering new terms or concepts that 
could enhance the discovery of relevant works.  
 
An online reference manager facilitated the documentation of search results and t heir respective 
sources. Furthermore, a comprehensive table was employed to log the results of each search, 
encompassing source details, term combinations, the count of located articles, and the date of 
each search. For every entry within this table, anoth er table was employed to record references 
and the evaluation of each reviewed article. Giving a brief description explaining the motive of 
acceptance or rejection and the acceptance topic to which they belong .

3.5. Review Protocol  
 
A partial review was conducted to identify potentially valuable research papers. During this 
review, the abstract of each article was carefully examined. Additionally, in certain cases, the 
introduction and  conclusions of the papers were also reviewed, and in specific instances, relevant 
sections of the article's body were studied. After thorough examination, each article was 
evaluated against the criteria specified in the protocol, and a decision was made r egarding its 
inclusion as a potentially valuable resource. To maintain control over the selection process, the 
tables as described earlier was employed to track accepted and rejected articles. Articles were 
considered for inclusion if they were related to any of the following Relevant Subject (RS), 
which are aligned with the research questions outlined above:  
 
 RS1: IoT technology.  
 RS2: Cybersecurity approaches for IoT technology.  
 RS3: Cybersecurity challenges specific to IoT technology.  
 RS4: Trust -Based Sys tems and frameworks tailored to IoT technology.  
 
Any article which contained the search terms or combinations of them, was initially gathered. An 
initial review was then carried out by reading through the abstract of each one, followed by a 
review of their  introduction and conclusions. Any article that did not contain relevant information 
on the subject area at hand, was excluded. Further exclusion criteria used:  
 
 The paper must present empirical data related to IoT and Cybersecurity techniques.  
 
 The paper  must be a peer -reviewed and published in a conference proceeding or journal.  
 
 The paper must have been in English language.  
 
Subsequently, a comprehensive assessment of these potential articles was conducted, with each 
article being scrutinized according to its alignment with the relevant subject areas. For articles 
falling under RS1 and RS2, a meticulous examination was carried out to identify the unique 
contribution to the knowledge of IoT technology as well as the limitations and inadequacies of 
traditi onal cybersecurity approaches in addressing the evolving security needs of IoT technology. 
For IoT technology, this entailed recording the reference, the proposed deployment mode, the 
associated architecture, and a concise description. For Cybersecurity ap proaches, the information 
encompassed the reference, the combination of the type and the specific technology involved, 
including a brief description. As for comparison and selection criteria, the recorded details 
encompassed the reference, the criteria uti lized, and a succinct description. Lastly, for decision 
outlines, the recorded information included the reference, a brief overview, and an evaluation of 
their advantages and disadvantages.  
 
In the case of articles classified under RS3 and RS4, an exhausti ve review was undertaken to gain 
a thorough understanding of their proposals and to discern their merits and drawbacks. Emerging 32                                       Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT)  
cybersecurity challenges specific to IoT technology, and how they differ from those in traditional 
network environments identif ied in the articles were reviewed. The primary studies selected were 
categorized into four acceptance areas, as detailed in Table 3.

Total  23 
 
A comprehensive search strategy was implemen ted, involving 50 distinct combinations of 
keywords across the specified databases. Figure 2. below illustrates the selection process, at each 
stage down to the final selection of primary studies. A total of 1,360 articles underwent initial 
review.  To enha nce the quality of the results, refinements were introduced in selected databases. 
In Scopus, the subject area was constrained to Computer Science and Computer Engineering, 
while Science Direct's content type was restricted to Research Articles and Review Articles. 
Additionally, in Google Scholar, only review articles where selected, resulting in a total of 125 
unique articles.  Among the 125 papers reviewed, duplicates were systematically removed, an 
initial screening identified 46 of these as potentially v aluable for the research. Subsequently, a 
more detailed analysis revealed that 28 of these potential papers were not pertinent to the current 
research and were therefore excluded. Forward and backward snowballing identified an 
additional 3 and 2 papers res pectively, leaving a final count of 23 papers that were deemed 
valuable and accepted.

4. RESULTS  
 
Our findings from the review of final selected papers shows that the paradigm of IoT  
technologies has maintained a consistent amount of interest among researchers in the past 5 years Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT)                                      33 
and the idea of deploying trust -based techniques as a means of Cybersecurity is seeing an upward 
trend. Figure 3. Below shows a chart of the number of primar y studies published by year . 
 
 
Figure 3. Number of Primary Studies Published by year  
 
To identify the common themes among the selected primary studies, a keyword analysis was 
conducted across a total of 23 studies. In Table 4 below, we can observe the frequency of specific 
words across all primary studies. The most frequently appearing keywords in our dataset are 
"IoT,” "IoT Networks," "Trust." , "Cybersecurity," "Cyberattack," and "IoT security. This fin ding 
underscores the growing interest in the integration of Trust Management within the context of the 
Internet of Things (IoT), which we will delve into further in Section 5.  
 
To allow for a simplified classification of the themes of the selected primary studies, they were 
further grouped into broader categories. Papers with a focus IoT and IIoT were grouped together, 
papers with a focus on Networking. IoT Networks and Wireless Sensor Networks were clustered 
together into the Networks category. Papers with  a primary focus connected to Trust, Trust 
Models, Trust Administration, Trust reputation, Trust Values were grouped into the category of 
Trust Management.  
 
Figure 4. below shows the percentage of themes for the selected primary studies grouped into 6 
major categories: IoT, Networks, Trust Management, Cybersecurity, Privacy and Datasets. The 
themes identified highlight that 45% of studies are focused on IoT, 18% are focused on 
Networks, while Cybersecurity accounts for 15%.  The 3rd most prevalent theme wi th 12% is 
Trust Management. Privacy and Datasets account for 5% each.

Internet of Things (IoT) being a recent innovative technology has already made some significant 
contributions to various industries and se ctors in a short period of time  [32]. The IoT network of 
physical devices, vehicles, appliances, and other objects embedded with sensors, software, and 
network connectivity have enhanc ed communication and data sharing  [1]. The implementation of 
IoT technology has seen an increase in recent years, offering unique opportunities for advances 
and inventions. However, this rap id proliferation of IoT devices has also brought forth unique 
cybersecurity challenges that cannot be ignored  [44]. As a result of the high -risk potential often 
involved in the processi ng of IoT data, the adoption of IoT has faced several challenges and 
setbacks in various industries  [4]-[6]. To maintain data integrity, availability and confidentiality 
security mechanisms have been put in place  [45]. Organizations have continued to deploy 
numerous solutio ns to prevent and mitigate cyberattacks and the resultant loses associated with 
these attacks and in some cases have had to deploy a combination of multiple solutions [46].  
 
There have b een different cyber security methods proposed over the years by researchers 
worldwide, all aimed at either preventing cyberattacks or mitigating the effects of successful 
attacks [47]. Whi lst some of these techniques are fully deployed and in use, there are several 
others still undergoing research  [28]. 
 
In the papers reviewed, security and privacy considerations have repeated ly emerged as the 
pivotal themes, and as a result been the primary focus of most investigations  [41]. The privacy 
and security challenges peculiar to IoT networks oftentimes require adapt ive solutions due to the 
unique attributes of IoT networks/devices, such as their large -scale deployment, diverse Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT)                                      35 
ecosystem, and computational capabilities inherent in the design and deployment  [40]. Privacy 
considerations in the design of IoT networks when viewed from a data provenance perspective, 
has led to scalability issues which introduces potential drawbacks [48]. To address these concerns 
and maintain privacy, security mechanisms like encryption and authentication have been 
deployed often [49]. The exploration of trust -based systems as a mea ns of addressing these 
scalability issues in IoT network designs is a future research endeavour.  The examination of 
cyber security datasets and trust -based systems by investigating novel methods of cloud security, 
communication and privacy issues is an eme rging area of interest [24]. Trust -based and trust -
provenance systems, as well as information, network, and database security methods for detecting 
and responding to cyberattacks in variou s technologies have been proposed by several 
researchers [50]-[52]. However, some of the proposed solutions focus on only one type of attack 
and due to scalability issues and can rarely be integrated into other technologies  [51]. 
 
5. DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION  
 
5.1. Basic Concepts  
 
5.1.1.  Trust  
 
The concept of trust is multidimensional and has been defined in so many ways across a diverse 
range of fields from social sciences to computing. The idea of Trust is closely interlinked to 
several other concepts such as Reputation and Trustworthiness wh ich are fundamental for making 
decisions in each of these areas. The definitions vary depending on the specific context in which 
it is being used, for example, in  [53], trust is describe d as a form of confidence, a belief in the 
expected behaviours or actions of an entity. Reputation on the other hand is defined by Khalid et 
al. [54] as the opinion an entity has on another’ s behaviours or actions. Trustworthiness is defined 
as the cumulative opinion of the behaviour or actions of another entity  [55]. The concepts of 
Trust, Reputation and Trustworthiness hav e been deployed in various industries for years and in 
recent times attempts have been made to integrate these concepts when designing IoT networks.  
In the context of IoT networks, Aldowah  et al. [56] define trust as the likelihood of a node 
adhering to expected behaviour. Similarly, trust can be defined as an agent's ability to provide 
high-quality services based on a mutually predefined parameter [57]. Another perspective of trust 
is the degree of belief in a node within a network of nodes  [58]. On the other hand, within 
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), trust is  defined as the degree of confidence in the assessment 
between communicating nodes  [10]. In addition, Gautam and Kumar [36] delineates trust as the 
measure of a nodes capacity to ensure predetermined services. Furthermore, in IoT -based WSNs, 
trust can be described as the measure of data quality exchanged among sensor nodes [48]. In 
summary, trust can be characterized as the level of interdependence between a trustor and a 
trustee based on previously established expectations  [59]. Ther efore, expectations, ability, 
capacity, belief, and capability emerge as common elements in the evaluation and establishment 
of trust . 
 
5.1.2.  Node Misbehaviour  
 
In IoT networks, when a node deliberately chooses not to co -operate, or behave in manner 
expected, th ey are classified as misbehaving nodes  [60]. There are usually two reasons for node 
misbehaviour; The node may be attempting to conserve power and not spend valuable resources 
such a s memory and CPU cycles for operations that are of no direct benefit to it, this is referred 
to as a Selfish node or the node may be attempting to cause damage to the network and is known 
as a Malicious node  [52]. Figure 5. below shows the types of node misbehaviours . 36                                       Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT)  
 
 
Figure 5. Node Misbehaviours  [52] 
 
Selfish nodes tend to exhibit traits  that conserve resources and optimize the advantages and an 
IoT network can still cope when a node exhibits selfish traits. The network can deploy resource 
incentives to guarantee node co -operation and there is the possibility of anticipating node 
misbehav iour. There are largely two classes of selfish node misbehaviour; intentional non 
forwarding/packet drop, and unintentional packet drop  [61]. Nodes which possess adequate 
resources and forwa rding capacity, and deliberately choose not to forward packets are wicked -
selfish nodes. In the case of unintentional packet drop, occurs when there is a software fault, or a 
lack of forwarding capacity or memory resources.  Malicious nodes introduce large data packets 
into a network which causes it to be overwhelmed and deplete its resources. Most networks fail to 
manage malicious node misbehaviour and rely on detecting and removing the node entirely from 
the network  [61]. Malicious node misbehaviour can be largely classed into 2 groups : forwarding 
and routing  [52]. Forwarding malicious nodes usually exhibit traits such as  packet dropping, 
modification, fabrication, timing attacks, and silent route change . 
 
5.2. State of The Art of Trust -Based Systems in Addressing Cybersecurity Needs in 
Iot Networks  
 
5.2.1.  Trust -Based Systems  
 
With the rapid advances in the realm of IoT networks and Wireless communication networks, the 
cyber threat landscape has continued to evolve at a similar pace, thus leading to unique threats 
and challenges. To address this need, a trust -based system is essential, one that can establish the 
protocols for ensuring  safety within an IoT network environment and subsequently detect 
anomalies. Trust -based systems have been deployed across multiple industries for years. In recent 
times, attempts have been made to model IoT networks, MANETs and WSNs as reputation -and-
trust-based systems [10], [48], [62] . Various types of trust -based systems and techniques fo r 
cybersecurity of IoT networks and devices have been proposed by researchers. We have grouped 
these techniques into three major categories, namely: Observation -Based, Knowledge -Based, 
Cluster -Based and Hybrid -Based systems. Figure 5. below shows the group s of Trust -based 
systems . Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT)                                      37 
 
 
Figure 6. Classifications of Trust -based Systems  
 
5.2.2.  Observation -Based Systems  
 
Observation based systems can be broadly categorized in two distinct areas, direct and indirect 
observation -based systems.  
 
 Direct observation: As the name implies, this type of system relies on direct observation 
or its own encounters to update reputation and trust [51]. 
 
 Indirect Observation: These systems prim arily depend shared experiences from other 
devices or nodes on the network that are passed along depending on the network 
configuration  [50]. 
 
Most of the systems proposed employ a combinatio n of both direct and indirect observation to 
update reputation and trust. This technique allows the system to draw upon the shared encounters 
of its neighbouring nodes or devices on the network. Wei et al. [51] proposed a trust management 
scheme for enhancing security in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks. In the proposed system, the trust 
value is computed using Bayesian inference from an observer node, whilst the indirect 
observation, is obtained from neighbour nodes and the trust value is calculated using the 
Dempster -Shafer theory (DST). The module of trust evaluation and update within the trust 
scheme entity updates reputation based on direct and indirect observation elements and then 
deploys two tec hniques; Bayesian inference and DST, to calculate and update the trust values. 
The trust values are then retained in trust repository module. A secure routing path between 
sources and destinations nodes can then be established within the networking module based on 
the trust repository module.  Data can be sent via the established secure routing paths by the 
application module. One benefit of this scheme is that node misbehaviours such as dropping or 
modifying packets can be quickly detected within the IoT ne twork and the compromised or 
selfish node excluded from the routing algorithm thereby increasing network throughput. 
However, one drawback with the proposed scheme is that as the number of nodes in the network 
increases the total message packets becomes la rger the overhead increases and dramatically slows 
down performance [51]. 
 
A trust -based security approach to address Wormhole and Gray hole attacks in mobile ad hoc 
networks using uncertain  reasoning is proposed by Mehta and Parmar  [50]. Their method also 
uses a combination of direct and indirect trust computed based on node observations.  In the 
proposed scheme, each node in RP L (Routing Protocol) network monitors its neighbouring nodes 
to detect any deviations from the defined protocols. Trust computation is based on trust metrics 
called as Direct Trust and Indirect Trust. One advantage of the proposed scheme is that it is 
energy efficient and does not create excessive network overheads. However, it is only effective 
when the malicious nodes are not colluding. When malicious nodes start collaborating, then they 
can help prolong the survival time of one another which dramatically  reduces the efficiency of 
the network.  
 38                                       Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT)  
5.2.3.  Knowledge -Based Systems  
 
Knowledge -Based systems could be classed as either Symmetric or Asymmetric.  
 
 Symmetric: In Symmetric -based systems, access to information cumulated from direct 
and indirect observation is a ccessed by all nodes and devices in the network. Thus, all 
devices or nodes in the network have the same level of knowledge required for making 
decisions  [52]. 
 
 Asymmetric: In Asymmetr ic-based systems, not all devices or nodes in the network have 
knowledge of all information.  
 
A trust -based approach for anonymous communication using asymmetric cryptography scheme is 
proposed by Wenjia and Song [63]. The proposed scheme is made up of two phases, namely data 
analysis and trust management. It can detect and cope with malicious attacks and evaluate the 
trustworthiness of both data and mobile nodes in VANETs.  However, one major dr awback of 
such Asymmetric -based systems is that since not all nodes on the network have access to the 
same amount of information, as the node density increases, the scheme introduces additional 
communication overhead.  
 
5.2.4.  Cluster -Based Systems  
 
Cluster -Based systems usually have a central device or node which carries out all the trust 
computations and maintains a repository of the status of all the nodes in the network. Improved 
security or efficiency is a major achievement of Cluster -based systems. Some class  of cluster -
based systems have all devices or nodes in the network and maintain a repository of residual 
information of the status of the other nodes and devices in the network. Researchers [64] 
proposed a trust -based Information sharing schemes for distributed collaborative networks. Their 
approach uses a central trust authority based on the recently proposed identity -based broadcast 
encryption (IBBE) technique.  
A cluster -based trust management  model for centralized cognitive radio networks is proposed by 
Qingqi et al [65]. The model can detect the malicious behaviour untrustworthy nodes. As shown 
in Figure 10 below in the central s tructure, the primary users and the second users distribute in 
the same geographic area. The primary base station (PBS) controls the primary users. The 
cognitive base station (CBS) controls the second users.  One advantage of the system is that it 
can detec t malicious node behaviour in the network, and protecting genuine second users 
from soft cyberattacks and collusion attacks to provide reliable security assurance for 
dynamic spectrum access. However, the major drawback is that the trust mechanism is 
uniqu e to the cognitive radio networks.  
 
5.3. State of the art of Trust -based systems in addressing cybersecurity needs in IoT 
Networks  
 
Trust metrics are essential for identifying, calculating, and evaluating trust values and trust 
properties in an IoT network. The  metrics deployed are usually largely dependent on several 
factors including the IoT network in question, the trust management technique as well as the 
evaluation parameters available. Trust properties is a commonly identified metric used for trust 
formati on in the review ed literature  [52]. 
 
 
 Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT)                                      39 
5.3.1.  Properties of Trust  
 
Trust -based systems are primarily comprised of three distinct properties. Durable nodes/devices 
that cumulate a repository o f protocols for future communication, compilation, and dissemination 
of information regarding ongoing communications and ensuring its availability for future 
reference and deployment of a propagation mechanism to aid the dissemination of trust 
information to peer nodes/devices on the network. According to researchers [64], the main 
constituents the trust metric are:   
 
Knowledge -Based systems could be classed as either Symmetric or Asymmetric.  
 
 Asymmetry: Trust is not symmetric in nature, meaning that, beca use node/device 1 trusts 
node/device 2, does not inevitably mean that nod e/device 2 trusts device 1  
 
 Transitivity: Trust is transitive in nature, meaning that, if node/device 1 trusts 
node/device 2 and node/device 2 trusts node/device 3, then node/device 1  trusts 
node/device 3.  
 
 Reflexivity: Trust is reflexive in nature, meaning that a node/devices’ default setting is to 
trust itself.  
 
5.3.2.  Trust -Based System Components  
 
There are several identified components of a trust -based system from the reviewed literature . One 
common approach is to classify trust -based models into five distinct areas: trust composition, 
trust aggregation, trust propagation, trust updation, and trust formation [66]. Figure 6 below  
shows the identified trust -based system components . 
 
5.3.2.1.  Trust Composition  
 
Trust composition includes the necessary elements required for effective trust computation [64]. 
These elements comprise  of quality of service (QoS) trust and social trust. QoS trust refers to the 
expectation that a node/device in an IoT network will provide a guaranteed quality of service or 
act in a manner as previously agreed upon based on pre -defined parameters such as execution 
time, availability, completion rate, execution time, turnaround time, and universal accessibility 
[67]. 
 
Social trust is particularly prominent is Social Internet of Things (SIoT)  and refers to the 
relationship that exists between nodes/devices in IoT networks, and the owner/vendor of these 
networks. Social trust is usually used to evaluate IoT nodes/devices based on several parameters 
such as security, reliability, and connectivity [64]. 
 
5.3.2.2.  Trust Aggregation  
 
Trust aggregation involves the collation of reputation information gathered from direct -
observations or indirect peer observation [64]. Prominent techniques for trust aggregation 
examined in the existing literature encompass fuzzy logic [68], regression analysis  [69], weighted 
summation [35], Bayesian inference  [70], and bel ief theory [71]. 
 
 
 40                                       Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT)  
 
5.3.2.3.  Trust Propagation  
 
Trust propagation is concerned with disseminating first -hand information gathered by nodes to 
node/device peers on the network [66]. The two common trust propagation schemes are 
distributed and centralized. In a centralized system, a single node/device maintains a central 
repository of the reputation of all network nodes/devices. Alshehr i and Hussain  [72] proposed the 
CTM -IoT mechanism which uses a Super Node (SN) as the centralized trust manager node. In 
their approach, the IoT network is divided into clusters t o achieve trustworthy communication 
between nodes with each cluster having a local trust manager called a Master Node (MN). One 
drawback of this mechanism is that it can create security and information bottlenecks if the 
central node is attacked. In a dist ributed system, each node/device in the system independently 
stores a repository of reputation information for peer nodes/devices. In this type of reputation 
system, challenges may arise regarding the consistency of reputation values across various nodes, 
potentially leading to a lack of coherence. A lightweight mechanism for mobile devices that 
effectively propagates trust and is distributed was designed b y Quercia et al.  [73]. This 
mecha nism uses a graph -based learning technique where nodes/devices are either rated or 
unrated, and those nodes are then connected to each other if they are related. The technique 
considers two nodes to be related when they possess identical ratings. Whilst di stributed systems 
solve the problems associated with centralized systems, they usually have large overheads often 
resulting in issues with scalability . 
 
5.3.2.4.  Trust Updation  
 
Trust updating deals with updating the trust value of each node/device on the IoT netwo rk [66]. 
Some IoT systems are designed to update trust at periodical intervals (time based)  [74], whilst 
some are designed to upd ate trust information based on discrete events (event -based)  [22]. 
 
5.3.2.5.  Trust Formation  
 
Trust formation refers to the process of decision making, and trust assessment based on various 
trust attributes [66]. In the reviewed literature, trust formation techniques are usually either 
single -trust and multi -trust based in IoT networks [29], [39], [41], [42], [66] . Trust -based 
decisions depend on reputation information provided by the aggregation component. The 
fundamental decision is binary, deciding on which node/device to trust and which node/device 
not to trust. This decision may result in actions such as cooperate/don't cooper ate, forward/don't 
forward, and so on, dependent upon the specific agreed upon matrices by the system .

Figure 7. Trust -based Systems components and metrics  
 
Some other metrics used for evaluating trust -based systems include.  
 
Reliability:  This involves ensuring that the IoT network functions with minimal errors or 
interruptions within a defined timeframe [72]. Implementing trust -based techniques require s the 
deployment of nodes that can carry out tasks that enhance the overall reliability of the network 
with availability within specified parameters.  
 
Efficiency:  This involves measuring the accuracy of the trust -based system in calculating trust 
values an d node reputation within pre -defined parameters [70]. 
 
Integrity:  This ensures that the node reputation information and its content are secure and 
unaltered during communic ation between nodes in the IoT network [68]. 
 
Scalability:  This refers to the capacity to which a trust -based system can be adapted to meet 
evolving conditions as the number of devices, nodes, or network needs changes [67]. 
 
Availability:  This guarantees that even when under attack the IoT network continues to proffer 
services [75]. Most trust -based systems achieve this by node segregation or clustering methods 
[51], [76] . 
 
Serviceability:  This guarantees that I oT network is easily modified or updated to accommodate 
necessary changes when an attack has been detected or new network vulnerabilities are identified 
[75]. 
 
5.4. Open issues and Future Challenge s of Trust -Based Systems in t he Iot  
 
From the reviewed literature we have identified several open issues and challenges for research 
on trust -based techniques in IoT.  
 
 Scalable Trust -based System for IoT:  With the projected increase in the number of IoT 
connected devices, there is a need to design scalable trust -based IoT solutions that can be 
easily adapted to accommodate the growing network demands. Most of the reviewed 
literature rarely mention trust -management techniques that can effectively resolve t he 
scalability issues.  
 42                                       Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT)  
 Trust -based DDoS Attack Detection System:  From the review literature, one of the 
most common attacks targeting IoT devices and networks are DDoS attacks. There seems 
to be a limited number of proposed Trust -based DDoS detection syst em. This would be 
an interesting area for further research.  
 
 AI and Machine learning as real -time Detection techniques for IoT Networks:  Real-
time detection techniques such as AI technology and machine learning can be adopted for 
enhancing the security in IoT networks. This is another interesting area that needs to be 
explored.  
 
 Blockchain for IoT Network Security:  From the reviewed literature very, few 
discussions have been had on the use of blockchain for the security of IoT networks. 
More work needs to b e done in exploring the design of lightweight blockchain -based 
solutions for resource -constrained IoT networks.  
 
 Edge and Cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) for IoT Networks:  The design of a 
scalable, easily adaptable cloud/edge computing infrastruct ure as a service solution for 
IoT networks is another area that requires further research.  
 
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  
 
We conducted a systematic literature review on systematic literature review (SLR) on the state of 
the art in literature of trust -based approaches as applied to cybersecurity of IoT. Based on the 
background studies, three research questions were created and a methodology was formulated to 
assist in searching the relevant databases to answer these questions.  From the reviewed literature , 
trust-based cyber security for IoT is an emerging area of interest with an increase in the number of  
recent studies. Trust -based systems  that can detect and prevent cyber attacks can significantly  
improve privacy and security within IoT networks.  The need for ongoing research and 
development in th is area is therefore imperative . As IoT technology continues to evolve, so will 
the t hreats and vulnerabilities . Therefore, it is necessary  to explore  further  developments and 
enhancement o f existing trust -based techniques  for IoT security. This includes investigating  
methods  for anomaly detection  and real -time monitoring aimed at proactively identif ying and 
respond ing to potential cybersecurity incidents.  This research has focused on studies related to 
IoT and the use of Trust -based techniques and their various applications. A review of the design 
approaches, and the key performance metrics for evaluating the efficiency of trust -based 
cybersecurity techniques was done. Finally, several open issues were identified an d further 
research directions on trust -based techniques in IoT networks were presented .
